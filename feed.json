				"content_html": "<p>A few weeks ago I <a href=\"https://updates.timsherratt.org/2022/09/01/making-nsw-postal.html\">created a new search interface</a> to the <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/nsw-post-office-directories/\">NSW Post Office Directories from 1886 to 1950</a>. Since then, I’ve used the same process on the <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/sydney-telephone-directories/\">Sydney Telephone Directories from 1926 to 1954</a>. Both of these publications had been digitised by the State Library of NSW and made available through Trove. To build the new interfaces I downloaded the text from Trove, indexed it by line, and linked it back to the online page images.</p>\n<p>But there are similar directories from other states that are not available through Trove. The Tasmanian Post Office Directory, for example, has been <a href=\"https://stors.tas.gov.au/ILS/SD_ILS-981598\">digitised between 1890 and 1948</a> and made available as 48 individual PDF files from Libraries Tasmania.

				"content_html": "<p>As part of my work on the <a href=\"https://everydayheritage.au/about/\">Everyday Heritage</a> project I’m looking at how we can make better use of digitised collections to explore the everyday experiences woven around places such as Parramatta Road in Sydney. For example, the NSW Postal Directories from <a href=\"https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-518308191\">1886 to 1908</a> and <a href=\"https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-522689844\">1909 to 1950</a> have been digitised by the State Library of NSW and made available through Trove.  The directories list residences and businesses by name and street location. Using them we can explore changes in the use of Parramatta Road across 60 years of history. But there’s a problem. While you can browse the directories page by page, searching is clunky. Trove’s main search indexes the contents of the directories by ‘article’. Each ‘article’ can be many pages long, so it’s difficult to focus in on the matching text. Clicking through from the search results to the digitised volume lands you in another set of search results, showing all the matches in the volume. However, the internal search index  works differently to the main Trove index. In particular it doesn’t seem to understand phrase or boolean searches. If you start off searching for “parramatta road” , Trove tells you there’s 50 matching articles, but if you click through to a volume you’re told there’s no results. If you remove the quotes you get every match for ‘parramatta’ or ‘road’. It’s all pretty confusing.</p>\n<p>The idea of ‘articles’ is really not very useful for publications like the Post Office Directories where information is mostly organised by column, row or line. You want to be able to search for a name, and go directly to the line in the directory where that name is mentioned. And now you can! Using Datasette, I’ve created an interface that searches <em>by line</em> across all 54 volumes of the NSW Post Office Directory from 1886 to 1950 (that’s over 30 million lines of text).</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/nsw-post-office-directories/\"><strong>Try it now!</strong></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"basic-features\">Basic features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The full text search supports phrase, boolean, and wildcard searches. Just enter your query in the main search box to get results from all 54 volumes in a flash.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each search result is a single line of text. Click on the link to view this line in context – it’ll show you 5 lines above and below your match, as well as a zoomable image of the digitised page from Trove.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For more context, you can click on <strong>View full page</strong> to see all the lines of text extracted from that page. You can then use the <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Previous</strong> buttons to browse page by page.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To view the full digitised volume, just click on the <strong>View page in Trove</strong> button.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n<p>There were a few stages involved in creating this resource, but mostly I was able to reuse bits of code from the GLAM Workbench’s Trove <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/\">journals</a> and <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-books/\">books</a> sections, and other related projects such as the <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/name-search/\">GLAM Name Index Search</a>.

				"content_text": "As part of my work on the [Everyday Heritage](https://everydayheritage.au/about/) project I’m looking at how we can make better use of digitised collections to explore the everyday experiences woven around places such as Parramatta Road in Sydney. For example, the NSW Postal Directories from [1886 to 1908](https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-518308191) and [1909 to 1950](https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-522689844) have been digitised by the State Library of NSW and made available through Trove.  The directories list residences and businesses by name and street location. Using them we can explore changes in the use of Parramatta Road across 60 years of history. But there’s a problem. While you can browse the directories page by page, searching is clunky. Trove’s main search indexes the contents of the directories by ‘article’. Each ‘article’ can be many pages long, so it’s difficult to focus in on the matching text. Clicking through from the search results to the digitised volume lands you in another set of search results, showing all the matches in the volume. However, the internal search index  works differently to the main Trove index. In particular it doesn’t seem to understand phrase or boolean searches. If you start off searching for “parramatta road” , Trove tells you there’s 50 matching articles, but if you click through to a volume you’re told there’s no results. If you remove the quotes you get every match for ‘parramatta’ or ‘road’. It’s all pretty confusing.\n\nThe idea of ‘articles’ is really not very useful for publications like the Post Office Directories where information is mostly organised by column, row or line. You want to be able to search for a name, and go directly to the line in the directory where that name is mentioned. And now you can! Using Datasette, I’ve created an interface that searches *by line* across all 54 volumes of the NSW Post Office Directory from 1886 to 1950 (that’s over 30 million lines of text). \n\n<a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/nsw-post-office-directories/\"><img class=\"u-photo\" src=\"https://updates.timsherratt.org/uploads/2022/cb7e107b84.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Screenshot of home page for the NSW Post Office Directories. There’s a search box to search across all 54 volumes, some search tips, and a summary of the data that notes there are more than 30 million rows.\" /></a>\n\n[**Try it now!**](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/nsw-post-office-directories/)\n\n## Basic features\n\n* The full text search supports phrase, boolean, and wildcard searches. Just enter your query in the main search box to get results from all 54 volumes in a flash.\n\n* Each search result is a single line of text. Click on the link to view this line in context – it’ll show you 5 lines above and below your match, as well as a zoomable image of the digitised page from Trove.\n\n* For more context, you can click on **View full page** to see all the lines of text extracted from that page. You can then use the **Next** and **Previous** buttons to browse page by page.\n\n* To view the full digitised volume, just click on the **View page in Trove** button.\n\n  \n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/8c1b80625f.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"335\" alt=\"Screenshot of information about a single row in the NSW Post Office Directories. The row is highlighted in yellow, and displayed in context with five rows above and below. There’s a button to view the full page, and box displaying a zoomable image of the page from Trove.\" />\n\n## How it works\n\nThere were a few stages involved in creating this resource, but mostly I was able to reuse bits of code from the GLAM Workbench’s Trove [journals](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/) and [books](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-books/) sections, and other related projects such as the [GLAM Name Index Search](https://glam-workbench.net/name-search/). Here’s a summary of the processing steps:\n\n* I started with the two top-level entries for the NSW Postal Directories, harvesting details of the 54 volumes under them.\n* For each of these 54 volumes, I downloaded the OCRd text **page by page**. Downloading the text by page, rather than volume, was very slow, but I thought it was important to be able to link each line of text back to its original page.\n* To create links back to pages, I also needed the individual identifiers for each page. A list of page identifiers is embedded as a JSON string within each volume’s HTML, so I extracted this data and matched the page ids to the text.\n* Using [sqlite-utils](https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/), I created a SQLite database with a separate table for every volume. Then I processed the text by volume, page, and line – adding each line line of text and its page details as a individual record in the database.\n* I then ran full text indexing across each line to make it easily searchable.\n* Using [Datasette](https://datasette.io/) and its [search-all plugin](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-search-all), I loaded up the database and BINGO! More than 30 million lines of text across 54 digitised volumes were instantly searchable. \n* To make it all public, I used Datasette’s `publish` function to push the database to Google’s Cloudrun service. \n\n[All the code is available in the journals section](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/create-text-db-indexed-by-line/) of the GLAM Workbench.\n\n## Future developments\n\nOne of the most exciting things to me is that this processing pipeline can be used with any digitised publication on Trove where it would be easier to search by line rather than article.

				"content_html": "<p>If you have a dataset that you want to share as a searchable online database then check out <a href=\"https://datasette.io/\">Datasette</a> – it’s a fabulous tool that provides an ever-growing range of options for exploring and publishing data. I particularly like how easy Datasette makes it to publish datasets on cloud services like Google’s Cloudrun and Heroku. A couple of weekends ago I migrated the <a href=\"https://resources.chineseaustralia.org/tung_wah_newspaper_index\">TungWah Newspaper Index</a> to Datasette. It’s now running on Heroku, and I can push updates to it in seconds.</p>\n<p>I’m also using Datasette as the platform for sharing data from the <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/anu-archives/\">Sydney Stock Exchange Project</a> that I’m working on with the ANU Archives. There’s a lot of data – more than 20 million rows – but getting it running on Google Cloudrun was pretty straightforward with Datasette’s <code>publish</code> command. The problem was, however, that Datasette is configured to run on most cloud services in ‘immutable’ mode and we want authenticated users to be able to improve the data. So I needed to explore alternatives.</p>\n<p>I’ve been working with <a href=\"https://ardc.edu.au/services/nectar-research-cloud/how-to-access-the-ardc-nectar-research-cloud/\">Nectar</a> over the past year to develop <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/using-nectar/\">a GLAM Workbench application</a> that helps researchers do things like harvesting newspaper articles from a Trove search. So I thought I’d have a go at setting up Datasette in a Nectar instance, and it works! Here’s a few notes on what I did…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First of course you need <a href=\"https://tutorials.rc.nectar.org.au/allocation-management/01-overview\">get yourself a resource allocation</a> on Nectar. I’ve also got a persistent volume storage allocation that I’m using for the data.</li>\n<li>From the Nectar Dashboard I made sure that I had an <a href=\"https://tutorials.rc.nectar.org.au/keypairs\">SSH keypair configured</a>, and created a <a href=\"https://tutorials.rc.nectar.org.au/sec-groups-101\">security group</a> to allow access via SSH, HTTP and HTTPS. I also <a href=\"https://tutorials.rc.nectar.org.au/volume-storage/01-overview\">set up a new storage volume</a>.</li>\n<li>I then <a href=\"https://tutorials.rc.nectar.org.au/launching-virtual-machines/01-overview\">created a new Virtual Machine</a> using the Ubuntu 22.04 image, and attaching the keypair, security group, and volume storage. For the stock exchange data I’m currently used the ‘m3.medium’ flavour of virtual machine which provides 8gb of RAM and 4 VCPUs. This might be overkill, but I went with the bigger machine because of the size of the SQLite database (around 2gb). This is similar to what I used on Cloudstor after I ran into problems with the memory limit. I think most projects would run perfectly well using one of the ‘small’ flavours. In any case, it’s easy to resize if you run into problems.</li>\n<li>Once the new machine was running I grabbed the IP address. Because I have DNS configured on my Nectar project, I also created a ‘datasette’ subdomain from the DNS dashboard by pointing an ‘A’ (alias) record to the IP address.</li>\n<li>Using the IP address I <a href=\"https://tutorials.rc.nectar.org.au/connecting/02-terminal-and-ssh\">logged into the new machine via SSH</a>.</li>\n<li>With all the Nectar config done, it was time to set up Datasette. I mainly just followed the <a href=\"https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/deploying.html\">excellent instructions in the Datasette documention</a> for deploying Datasette using <code>systemd</code>. This involved installing <code>datasette</code> via <code>pip</code>, creating a folder for the Datasette data and configuration files, creating a <code>datasette.service</code> file for <code>systemd</code>.</li>\n<li>I also used the <code>datasette install</code> command to add a couple of Datasette plugins. One of these is the <code>datasette-github-auth</code> plugin, which needs a couple of secret tokens set. I added these as environment variables in the <code>datasette.service</code> file.</li>\n<li>The <code>systemd</code> setup uses Datasette’s <a href=\"https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/settings.html#configuration-directory-mode\">configuration directory mode</a>. This means you can put your database, metadata definitions, custom templates and CSS, and any other settings all together in a single directory and Datasette will find and use them. I’d previously passed runtime settings via the command line, so I had to create a <code>settings.json</code> for these.</li>\n<li>Then I just uploaded all my Datasette database and configuration files to the folder I created on the virtual machine using <code>rsync</code> and started the Datasette service. It worked!</li>\n<li>The next step was to use the persistent volume storage for my Datasette files. The persistent storage exists independently of the virtual machine, so you don’t need to worry about losing data if there’s a change to the instance. I mounted the storage volume as <code>/pvol</code> in the virtual machine <a href=\"https://tutorials.rc.nectar.org.au/volume-storage/04-format-mount\">as the Nectar documentation describes</a>.</li>\n<li>I created a <code>datasette-root</code> folder under <code>pvol</code>, copied the Datasette files to it, and changed the <code>datasette.service</code> file to point to it. This didn’t seem to work and I’m not sure why. So instead I created a symbolic link between <code>/home/ubuntu/datasette-root</code> and <code>/pvol/datasette-root</code> and and set the path in the service file back to <code>/home/ubuntu/datasette-root</code>.

				"content_html": "<p>The ARDC is collecting user requirements for the <a href=\"https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/strategic-activities/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/project-plans/trove-researcher-platform-for-advanced-research-project-plan/\">Trove researcher platform for advanced research</a>. This is a chance to start from scratch, and think about the types of data, tools, or interface enhancements that would support innovative research in the humanities and social sciences. The ARDC will be holding <a href=\"https://ardc.edu.au/events/trove-researcher-platform-roundtables/\">two public roundtables</a>, on 13 and 20 May, to gather ideas. I created a list of possible API improvements in my response to last year&rsquo;s draft plan, and thought it might be useful to expand that a bit, and add in a few other annoyances, possibilities, and long-held dreams.</p>\n<p>My focus is again on the data; this is for two reasons. First because public access to consistent, good quality data makes all other things possible. But, of course, it&rsquo;s never just a matter of OPENING ALL THE DATA. There will be questions about priorities, about formats, about delivery, about normalisation and enrichment. Many of these questions will arise as people try to make use of the data. There needs to be an ongoing conversation between data providers, research tool makers, and research tool users. This is the second reason I think the data is critically important – our focus should be on developing communities and skills, not products. A series of one-off tools for researchers might be useful, but the benefits will wane. Building tools through networks of collaboration and information sharing based on good quality data offers much more. Researchers should be participants in these processes, not consumers.</p>\n<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s my current wishlist&hellip;</p>\n<h2 id=\"apis-and-data\">APIs and data</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bring the web interface and main public API back into sync, so that researchers can easily transfer queries between the two.</strong> The Trove interface update in 2020 reorganised resources into &lsquo;categories&rsquo;, replacing the original &lsquo;zones&rsquo;. The API, however, is still organised by zone and knows nothing about these new categories. Why does this matter? The web interface allows researchers to explore the collection and develop research questions. Some of these questions might be answered by downloading data from the API for analysis or visualisation. But, except for the newspapers, there is currently no one-to-one correspondence between searches in the web interface and searches using the API. There&rsquo;s no way of transferring your questions – you need to start again.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Expand the metadata available for digitised resources other than newspapers.</strong> In recent years, the NLA has digitised huge quantities of books, journals, images, manuscripts, and maps. The digitisation process has generated new metadata describing these resources, but most of this is not available through the public API. We can get an idea of what&rsquo;s missing by comparing the digitised journals to the newspapers. The API includes <a href=\"https://troveconsole.herokuapp.com/#get-a-list-of-all-newspaper-titles\">a <code>newspaper</code> endpoint</a> that provides data on all the newspapers in Trove. You can use it to get a list of available issues for any newspaper. There is no comparable way of retrieving a list of digitised journals, or the issues that have been digitised. The data’s somewhere – there&rsquo;s an internal API that’s used to generate lists of issues in the browse interface and I&rsquo;ve <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/get-ocrd-text-from-digitised-journal/\">scraped this to harvest issue details</a>. But this information should should be in the public API. Manuscripts are described using finding aids, themselves generated from EAD formatted XML files, but none of this important structured data is available from the API, or for download. There’s also <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-books/metadata-for-digital-works/\">other resource metadata</a>, such as parent/child relationships between different levels in the object hierarchy (eg publication &gt; pages). These are embedded in web pages but not exposed in the API. The main point is that when it comes to data-driven research, <strong>digitised books, journals, manuscripts, images, and maps are second-class citizens</strong>, trailing far behind the newspapers in research possibilities. There needs to be a thorough stocktake of available metadata, and a plan to make this available in machine actionable form.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Standardise the delivery of text, images, and PDFs and provide download links through the API.</strong> As noted above, digitised resources are treated differently depending on where they sit in Trove. There are no standard mechanisms for downloading the products of digitisation, such as OCRd text and images. OCRd text is available directly though the API for newspaper and journal articles, but to download text from a book or journal issue you need to hack the download mechanisms from the web interface. Links to these should be included in the API. Similarly, machine access to images requires various hacks and workarounds. There should be a consistent approach that allows researchers to compile image datasets from digitised resources using the API. Ideally IIIF standard APIs should be used for the delivery of images and maps. This would enable the use of the growing ecosystem of IIIF compliant tools for integration, analysis, and annotation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Provide an option to exclude search results in tags and comments.</strong> The Trove advanced search used to give you the option of excluding search results which only matched tags or comments, rather than the content of the resource. Back when I was working at Trove, the IT folks said this feature would be added to a future version of the API, but instead it disappeared from the web interface with the 2020 update! Why is this important? If you&rsquo;re trying to analyse the occurance of search terms within a collection, such as Trove&rsquo;s digitised newspapers, you want to be sure that the result reflects the actual content, and not a recent annotation by Trove users.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Finally add the People &amp; Organisations data to the main API.</strong> Trove&rsquo;s People &amp; Organisations section was ahead of the game in providing machine-readable access, but the original API is out-of-date and uses a completely different query language. Some work was done on adding it to the main RESTful API, but it was never finished. With a bit of long-overdue attention, the People &amp; Organisations data could power new ways of using and linking biographical resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improve web archives CDX API.</strong> Although the NLA does little to inform researchers of the possibilities, the web archives software it uses (Pywb) includes some baked in options for retrieving machine-readable data. This includes <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/timegates-timemaps-mementos/\">support for the Memento protocol</a>, and the provision of a CDX API that delivers basic metadata about individual web page captures. The current CDX API has some limitations ( <a href=\"https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/web-archives/blob/master/comparing_cdx_apis.ipynb\">documented here</a> ). In particular, there&rsquo;s no pagination or results, and no support for domain-level queries. Addressing these limitations would make the existing CDX API much more useful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Provide new data sources for web archives analysis.</strong> There needs to be an constructive, ongoing discussion about the types of data that could be extracted and shared from the Australian web archive. For example, a search API, or downloadable datasets of word frequencies. The scale is a challenge, but some pilot studies could help us all understand both the limits and the possibilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Provide a Write API for annotations.</strong> Integration between components in the HASS RDC would be greatly enhanced if other projects could automatically add structured annotations to existing Trove resources. Indeed, this would create exciting possibilities for embedding Trove resources within systems of scholarly analysis, allowing insights gained through research to be automatically fed back into Trove to enhance discovery and understanding.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Provide historical statistics on Trove resources.</strong> It&rsquo;s important for researchers to understand how Trove itself changes over time. There used to be a page that provided regularly-updated statistics on the number of resources and user annotations, but this was removed by the interface upgrade in 2020. I&rsquo;ve <a href=\"https://github.com/wragge/trove-newspaper-totals\">started harvesting some basic stats</a> relating to Trove newspapers, but access to general statistics should be reinstated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reassess key authentication and account limits.</strong> DigitalNZ recently <a href=\"https://digitalnz.org/blog/posts/accessing-the-digitalnz-api\">changed their policy around API authentication</a>, allowing public access without a key. Authentication requirements hinder exploration and limit opportunities for using the API in teaching and workshops. Similarly, I don&rsquo;t think the account usage limits have been changed since the API was released, even though the capacity of the systems has increased. It seems like time that both of these were reassessed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ok, I&rsquo;ll admit, that&rsquo;s a pretty long list, and not everything can be done immediately! I think this would be a good opportunity for the NLA to develop and share an API and Data Roadmap, that is regularly updated, and invites comments and suggestions. This would help researchers plan for future projects, and build a case for further government investment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"integration\">Integration</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Unbreak Zotero integration.</strong> The 2020 interface upgrade broke the existing Zotero integration and there&rsquo;s no straightforward way of fixing it without changes at the Trove end. Zotero used to be able to capture search results, metadata and images from most of the zones in Trove. Now it can only capture individual newspaper articles. This greatly limits the ability of researchers to assemble and manage their own research collections. More generally, a program to examine and support <a href=\"https://updates.timsherratt.org/2022/01/29/zotero-support-in.html\">Zotero integration across the GLAM sector</a> would be a useful way of spending some research infrastructure dollars.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Provide useful page metadata</strong>. Zotero is just one example of a tool that can extract structured metadata from web pages. Such metadata supports reuse and integration, without the need for separate API requests. Only Trove&rsquo;s newspaper articles currently provide embedded metadata. Libraries used to lead the way is promoting the use of standardised, structured, embedded page metadata (Dublin Core anyone?), but now?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Explore annotation frameworks.</strong> I&rsquo;ve mentioned the possibility of a Write API for annotations above, but there are other possibilities for supporting web scale annotations, such as <a href=\"https://web.hypothes.is/\">Hypothesis</a>. Again, the current Trove interface makes the use of Hypothesis difficult, and again this sort of integration would be usefully assessed across the whole GLAM sector.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"tools--interfaces\">Tools &amp; interfaces</h2>\n<p>Obviously any discussion of new tools or interfaces needs to start by looking at what&rsquo;s already available. This is difficult when the NLA won&rsquo;t even link to existing resources such as the <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/\">GLAM Workbench</a>. Sharing information about existing tools needs to be the starting point from which to plan investment in the Trove Researcher Platform. From there we can identify gaps and develop processes and collaborations to meet specific research needs. Here&rsquo;s a list of some <a href=\"https://updates.timsherratt.org/2022/05/02/working-with-trove.html\">Trove-related tools and resources</a> currently available through the GLAM Workbench.</p>\n<h2 id=\"update-18-may-some-extra-bonus-bugs\">Update (18 May): some extra bonus bugs</h2>\n<p>I forgot to add these annoying bugs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>newspaper</code> endpoint returns both newspaper and gazette titles, even though there&rsquo;s a separate <code>gazette</code> endpoint.

				"content_html": "<p>The ARDC is organising <a href=\"https://ardc.edu.au/events/trove-researcher-platform-roundtables/\">a couple of public forums</a> to help gather researcher requirements for the <a href=\"https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/strategic-activities/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/project-plans/trove-researcher-platform-for-advanced-research-project-plan/\">Trove component of the HASS RDC</a>. One of the roundtables will look at &lsquo;Existing tools that utilise Trove data and APIs&rsquo;. Last year I wrote a summary of what <a href=\"https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/08/26/glam-workbench-a.html\">the GLAM Workbench can contribute to the development of humanities research infrastructure</a>, particularly in regard to Trove. I thought it might be useful to update that list to include recent additions to the GLAM Workbench, as well as a range of other datasets, software, tools, and interfaces that exist outside of the GLAM Workbench.</p>\n<p>Since last year&rsquo;s post I&rsquo;ve also been working hard to integrate the GLAM Workbench with other eResearch services such as <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/using-nectar/\">Nectar</a> and <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/glam-tools/\">CloudStor</a>, and to document and support the ways that <a href=\"https://updates.timsherratt.org/2022/03/02/the-glam-workbench.html\">individuals and institutions can contribute</a> code and documentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-and-moving-data\">Getting and moving data</h2>\n<p>There’s lots of fabulous data in Trove and other GLAM collections. In fact, there’s so much data that it can be difficult for researchers to find and collect what’s relevant to their interests. There are many tools in the GLAM Workbench to help researchers assemble their own datasets. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/\">Get newspaper articles in bulk with the Trove Newspaper and Gazette Harvester</a></strong> – This has been around in some form for more than ten years (it pre-dates the Trove API!). Give it the url of a search in Trove’s newspapers and gazettes and the harvester will save all the metadata in a CSV file, and optionally download the complete articles as OCRd text, images, or PDFs. The amount of data you harvest is really only limited by your patience and disk space. I’ve harvested more than a million articles in the past. The GLAM Workbench includes a web app version of the harvester that runs live in the cloud – just paste in your Trove API key and the search url, and click the button.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#harvest-information-about-newspaper-issues\"><strong>Harvest information about newspaper issues</strong></a> – When you search Trove&rsquo;s newspapers, you find articles – these articles are grouped by page, and all the pages from a particular date make up an issue. But how do you find out what issues are available? On what dates were newspapers published? This notebook shows how you can get information about issues from the Trove API.</li>\n<li><strong>Get Trove newspaper pages as images</strong> – If you need a nice, high-resolution version of a newspaper page you can <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#download-a-page-image\">use this web app</a>. If you want to harvest every front page (or some other particular page) here’s an example that <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#harvest-australian-womens-weekly-covers-or-the-front-pages-of-any-newspaper\">gets all the covers of the <em>Australian Women’s Weekly</em></a>. A pre-harvested <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#australian-womens-weekly-front-covers-1933-to-1982\">collection of the AWW covers</a> is included as a bonus extra.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#save-a-trove-newspaper-article-as-an-image\">Get Trove newspaper articles as images</a></strong> – The Trove web interface makes it difficult to download complete images of articles, but this tool will do the job. There’s a handy web app to grab individual images, but the code from this tool is reused in other places such as the Trove Newspaper Harvester and the Omeka uploader, and could be built-in to your own research workflows.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#harvest-the-issues-of-a-newspaper-as-pdfs\"><strong>Harvest the issues of a newspaper as PDFs</strong></a> – This notebook harvests <em>whole issues</em> of newspapers as PDFs – one PDF per issue.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#upload-trove-newspaper-articles-to-omeka-s\">Upload Trove newspaper articles to Omeka</a></strong> – Whether you’re creating on online exhibition or building a research database, Omeka can be very useful. This notebook connects Trove’s newspapers to Omeka for easy upload. Your selected articles can come from a search query, a Trove list, a Zotero library, or just a list of article ids. Metadata records are created in Omeka for each article and newspaper, and an image of each article is attached. My <a href=\"https://wragge.github.io/omeka_s_tools/api.html\">Omeka S Tools software package</a> also includes an example using Trove newspapers.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#get-ocrd-text-from-a-digitised-journal-in-trove\">Get OCRd text from digitised periodicals in Trove</a></strong> – They’re often overshadowed by the newspapers, but there’s now lots of digitised journals, magazines, and parliamentary papers in Trove. You can get article-level data from the API, but not issue data. This notebook enables researchers to get metadata and OCRd text from every available issue of a periodical. To make researchers’ lives even easier, I regularly harvest <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#ocrd-text-from-trove-digitised-journals\"><strong>all</strong> the available OCRd text</a> from digitised periodicals in Trove. The latest harvest downloaded 51,928 issues from 1,163 periodicals – that’s about 10gb of text. You can <a href=\"https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/trove-journals/blob/master/digital-journals-with-text.md\">browse the list of periodicals</a> with OCRd text, or <a href=\"https://trove-digital-periodicals.glitch.me/data/trove-digital-journals\">search this database</a>. All the OCRd text is stored in a public repository on CloudStor.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#get-covers-or-any-other-pages-from-a-digitised-journal-in-trove\">Get page images from digitised periodicals in Trove</a></strong> – There’s more than text in digitised periodicals, and you might want to download images of pages for visual analysis. This notebook shows you how to get cover images, but could be easily modified to get another page, or a PDF. I used a modified version of this to create <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#editorial-cartoons-from-the-bulletin-1886-to-1952\">a collection of 3,471 full page editorial cartoons</a> from <em>The Bulletin</em>, 1886 to 1952 – all available to download from CloudStor.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-books/#harvesting-the-text-of-digitised-books-and-ephemera\">Get OCRd text from digitised books in Trove</a></strong> – Yep, there’s digitised books as well as newspapers and periodicals. You can download OCRd text from an individual book using the Trove web interface, but how do you make a collection of books without all that pointing and clicking? This notebook downloads all the available OCRd text from digitised books in Trove. The latest harvest includes <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-books/#ocrd-text-from-trove-books-and-ephemera\">text from 26,762 works</a>. You can explore the results <a href=\"https://trove-digital-books.glitch.me/data/trove-digital-books\">using this database</a>.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#harvest-parliament-press-releases-from-trove\">Harvest parliamentary press releases from Trove</a></strong> – Trove includes more than 380,000 press releases, speeches, and interview transcripts issued by Australian federal politicians and saved by the Parliamentary Library. This notebook shows you how to harvest both metadata and fulltext from a search of the parliamentary press releases. For example, here’s a collection of <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#politicians-talking-about-immigrants-and-refugees\">politicians talking about ‘refugees’</a>, and another <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#politicians-talking-about-covid\">relating to COVID-19</a>.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-music/#harvest-abc-radio-national-records-from-trove\">Harvest details of Radio National programs from Trove</a></strong> – Trove creates records for programs broadcast on ABC Radio National, for the major current affairs programs these records at at segment level. Even though they don’t provide full transcripts, this data provide a rich, fine-grained record of Australia’s recent political, social, and economic history. This notebook shows you how to download the Radio National data. If you just want to dive straight in, there’s also a <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-music/#abc-radio-national-programs\">pre-harvested collection</a> containing more than 400,000 records, with separate downloads for some of the main programs.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#find-all-the-archived-versions-of-a-web-page\">Find all the versions of an archived web page in Trove</a></strong> – Many of the tools in the <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/\">Web Archives section</a> of the GLAM Workbench will work with the Australian Web Archive, which is part of Trove. This notebook shows you how to get data about the number of times a web page has been archived over time.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#harvesting-collections-of-text-from-archived-web-pages\">Harvesting collections of text from archived web pages in Trove</a></strong> – If you want to explore how the content of a web page changes over time, you can use this notebook to capture the text content of every archived version of a web page.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#convert-a-trove-list-into-a-csv-file\">Convert a Trove list into a CSV file</a></strong> – While Trove provides a data download option for lists, it leaves out a lot of useful data. This notebook downloads full details of newspaper articles and other works in a list and saves them as CSV files. Like the Trove Newspaper Harvester, it lets you download OCRd text and images from newspaper articles.</li>\n<li><strong>Collecting information about Trove user activity</strong> – It’s not just the content of Trove that provides interesting research data, it’s also the way people engage with it. Using the Trove API it’s possible to harvest details of <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/\">all user created lists and tags</a>. And yes, there’s pre-harvested collections of <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#trove-lists-metadata\">lists</a> and <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#trove-public-tags\">tags</a> for the impatient.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While I’m focusing here on Trove, there’s also tools to create datasets from the <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/recordsearch/\">National Archives of Australia</a>, <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/digitalnz/\">Digital NZ and Papers Past</a>, the <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/nma/\">National Museum of Australia</a> and more. And there’s a <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/glam-data-list/\">big list of readily downloadable datasets</a> from Australian GLAM organisations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"visualisation-and-analysis\">Visualisation and analysis</h2>\n<p>Many of the notebooks listed above include examples that demonstrate ways of exploring and analysing your harvested data. There are also a number of companion notebooks that examine some possibilities in more detail, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/#exploring-your-troveharvester-data\">Explore your Trove newspaper harvests</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/#display-the-results-of-a-harvest-as-a-searchable-database-using-datasette\">Load your Trove newspaper harvest in Datasette</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-music/#exploring-abc-radio-national-metadata\">Exploring ABC Radio National metadata</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#analyse-public-tags-added-to-trove\">Analyse public tags added to Trove</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>But there are also many other notebooks that demonstrate methods for analysing Trove’s content, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#querypic\">QueryPic</a></strong> – Another tool that’s been around in different forms for a decade, QueryPic visualises searches in Trove’s newspapers. The latest web app couldn’t be simpler, just paste in your API key and a search url and create charts showing the number of matching articles over time. You can combine queries, change time scales, and download the data and visualisations. Interested to see how other researchers have used it? Here&rsquo;s a <a href=\"https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/08/30/some-research-projects.html\">Twitter thread with links to some publications</a>.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#visualise-trove-newspaper-searches-over-time\">Visualise Trove newspaper searches over time</a></strong> – This is like a deconstructed version of QueryPic that walks you through the process of using Trove’s facets to assemble a dataset of results over time. It provide a lot of detail on the sorts of data available, and the questions we can ask of it.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#visualise-the-total-number-of-newspaper-articles-in-trove-by-year-and-state\">Visualise the total number of newspaper articles in Trove by year and state</a></strong> – This notebook uses a modified version of the code above to analyse the construction and context of Trove’s newspaper corpus itself. What are you actually searching? Meet the WWI effect and the copyright cliff of death! This is a great place to start if you want to get people thinking critically about digital resources are constructed.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/examples/trove_newspaper_issues_per_day.html\">Trove newspapers – number of issues per day, 1803–2020</a></strong> – visualisation of the number of newspaper issues published <strong>every day</strong> in Trove.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#analyse-rates-of-ocr-correction\">Analyse rates of OCR correction</a></strong> – Some more meta-analysis of the Trove corpus itself, this time focusing on patterns of OCR correction by Trove users.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#finding-non-english-newspapers-in-trove\">Identifying non-English language newspapers in Trove</a></strong> – There are a growing number of non-English language newspapers digitised in Trove. However, if you&rsquo;re only searching using English keywords, you might never know that they&rsquo;re there. This notebook analyses a sample of articles from every newspaper in Trove to identify non-English content.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#beyond-the-copyright-cliff-of-death\">Beyond the copyright cliff of death</a></strong> – Most of the newspaper articles on Trove were published before 1955, but there are some from the later period. This notebook helps you find out how many, and which newspapers they were published in.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#map-trove-newspaper-results-by-state\">Map Trove newspaper results by state</a></strong> – This notebook uses the Trove <code>state</code> facet to create a choropleth map that visualises the number of search results per state.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#map-trove-newspaper-results-by-place-of-publication\">Map Trove newspaper results by place of publication</a></strong> – This notebook uses the Trove <code>title</code> facet to find the number of results per newspaper, then merges the results with a dataset of geolocated newspapers to map where articles were published.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#compare-two-versions-of-an-archived-web-page\">Compare two versions of an archived web page</a></strong> – This notebook demonstrates a number of different ways of comparing versions of archived web pages. Just choose a repository, enter a url, and select two dates to see comparisons based on: page metadata, basic statistics such as file size and number of words, numbers of internal and external links, cosine similarity of text, line by line differences in text or code, and screenshots.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#display-changes-in-the-text-of-an-archived-web-page-over-time\">Display changes in the text of an archived web page over time</a></strong> – This web app gathers all the available versions of a web page and then visualises changes in its content between versions – what’s been added, removed, and changed?</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#using-screenshots-to-visualise-change-in-a-page-over-time\">Use screenshots to visualise change in a page over time</a></strong>– Create a series of full page screenshots of a web page over time, then assemble them into a time series.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are also possibilities for using Trove data creatively. For example you can <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#create-scissors-and-paste-messages-from-trove-newspaper-articles\">create &lsquo;scissors and paste&rsquo; messages from Trove newspaper articles</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"documentation-and-examples\">Documentation and examples</h2>\n<p>All the Trove notebooks in the GLAM Workbench help document the possibilities and limits of the Trove API. The examples above can be modified and reworked to suit different research interests. Some notebooks also explore particular aspects of the API, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove/\">Trove API Introduction</a></strong> – Some very basic examples of making requests and understanding results.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#todays-news-yesterday\">Today’s news yesterday</a></strong> – Uses the <code>date</code> index and the <code>firstpageseq</code> parameter to find articles from exactly 100 years ago that were published on the front page. It then selects one of the articles at random and downloads and displays an image of the front page.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-images/#the-use-of-standard-licences-and-rights-statements-in-trove-image-records\">The use of standard licences and rights statements in Trove image records</a></strong> – Version 2.1 of the Trove API introduced a new rights index that you can use to limit your search results to records that include one of a list of standard licences and rights statements. We can also use this index to build a picture of which rights statements are currently being used, and by who.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-random/\">Random items from Trove</a></strong> – Changes to the Trove API meant that techniques you could previously use to select resources at random no longer work. This section documents some alternative ways of retrieving random-ish works and newspaper articles from Trove.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And while it’s not officially part of the GLAM Workbench, I also maintain the <a href=\"https://troveconsole.herokuapp.com/\">Trove API Console</a> which provides lots of examples of the API in action.</p>\n<h2 id=\"videos\">Videos</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve started making videos to help you get started with the GLAM Workbench.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/vdyKNowv9gw\"><strong>GLAM Workbench – use QueryPic to visualise searches in Trove&rsquo;s digitised newspapers</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/J_LgNL2EM4M\"><strong>GLAM Workbench – use QueryPic to visualise searches in Trove&rsquo;s digitised newspapers (part 2)</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/WKFuJR6lLF4\"><strong>GLAM Workbench – using the Trove Newspaper &amp; Gazette Harvester (the web app version)</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"datasets\">Datasets</h2>\n<p>A number of pre-harvested datasets are noted above in the &lsquo;Getting and moving data&rsquo; section.

				"content_text": "The ARDC is organising [a couple of public forums](https://ardc.edu.au/events/trove-researcher-platform-roundtables/) to help gather researcher requirements for the [Trove component of the HASS RDC](https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/strategic-activities/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/project-plans/trove-researcher-platform-for-advanced-research-project-plan/). One of the roundtables will look at 'Existing tools that utilise Trove data and APIs'. Last year I wrote a summary of what [the GLAM Workbench can contribute to the development of humanities research infrastructure](https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/08/26/glam-workbench-a.html), particularly in regard to Trove. I thought it might be useful to update that list to include recent additions to the GLAM Workbench, as well as a range of other datasets, software, tools, and interfaces that exist outside of the GLAM Workbench. \n\nSince last year's post I've also been working hard to integrate the GLAM Workbench with other eResearch services such as [Nectar](https://glam-workbench.net/using-nectar/) and [CloudStor](https://glam-workbench.net/glam-tools/), and to document and support the ways that [individuals and institutions can contribute](https://updates.timsherratt.org/2022/03/02/the-glam-workbench.html) code and documentation.\n\n## Getting and moving data\n\nThere’s lots of fabulous data in Trove and other GLAM collections. In fact, there’s so much data that it can be difficult for researchers to find and collect what’s relevant to their interests. There are many tools in the GLAM Workbench to help researchers assemble their own datasets. For example:\n\n* **[Get newspaper articles in bulk with the Trove Newspaper and Gazette Harvester](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/)** – This has been around in some form for more than ten years (it pre-dates the Trove API!). Give it the url of a search in Trove’s newspapers and gazettes and the harvester will save all the metadata in a CSV file, and optionally download the complete articles as OCRd text, images, or PDFs. The amount of data you harvest is really only limited by your patience and disk space. I’ve harvested more than a million articles in the past. The GLAM Workbench includes a web app version of the harvester that runs live in the cloud – just paste in your Trove API key and the search url, and click the button. \n* [**Harvest information about newspaper issues**](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#harvest-information-about-newspaper-issues) – When you search Trove's newspapers, you find articles – these articles are grouped by page, and all the pages from a particular date make up an issue. But how do you find out what issues are available? On what dates were newspapers published? This notebook shows how you can get information about issues from the Trove API. \n* **Get Trove newspaper pages as images** – If you need a nice, high-resolution version of a newspaper page you can [use this web app](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#download-a-page-image). If you want to harvest every front page (or some other particular page) here’s an example that [gets all the covers of the *Australian Women’s Weekly*](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#harvest-australian-womens-weekly-covers-or-the-front-pages-of-any-newspaper). A pre-harvested [collection of the AWW covers](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#australian-womens-weekly-front-covers-1933-to-1982) is included as a bonus extra.\n* **[Get Trove newspaper articles as images](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#save-a-trove-newspaper-article-as-an-image)** – The Trove web interface makes it difficult to download complete images of articles, but this tool will do the job. There’s a handy web app to grab individual images, but the code from this tool is reused in other places such as the Trove Newspaper Harvester and the Omeka uploader, and could be built-in to your own research workflows.\n* [**Harvest the issues of a newspaper as PDFs**](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#harvest-the-issues-of-a-newspaper-as-pdfs) – This notebook harvests *whole issues* of newspapers as PDFs – one PDF per issue. \n* **[Upload Trove newspaper articles to Omeka](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#upload-trove-newspaper-articles-to-omeka-s)** – Whether you’re creating on online exhibition or building a research database, Omeka can be very useful. This notebook connects Trove’s newspapers to Omeka for easy upload. Your selected articles can come from a search query, a Trove list, a Zotero library, or just a list of article ids. Metadata records are created in Omeka for each article and newspaper, and an image of each article is attached. My [Omeka S Tools software package](https://wragge.github.io/omeka_s_tools/api.html) also includes an example using Trove newspapers.\n* **[Get OCRd text from digitised periodicals in Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#get-ocrd-text-from-a-digitised-journal-in-trove)** – They’re often overshadowed by the newspapers, but there’s now lots of digitised journals, magazines, and parliamentary papers in Trove. You can get article-level data from the API, but not issue data. This notebook enables researchers to get metadata and OCRd text from every available issue of a periodical. To make researchers’ lives even easier, I regularly harvest [**all** the available OCRd text](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#ocrd-text-from-trove-digitised-journals) from digitised periodicals in Trove. The latest harvest downloaded 51,928 issues from 1,163 periodicals – that’s about 10gb of text. You can [browse the list of periodicals](https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/trove-journals/blob/master/digital-journals-with-text.md) with OCRd text, or [search this database](https://trove-digital-periodicals.glitch.me/data/trove-digital-journals). All the OCRd text is stored in a public repository on CloudStor.\n* **[Get page images from digitised periodicals in Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#get-covers-or-any-other-pages-from-a-digitised-journal-in-trove)** – There’s more than text in digitised periodicals, and you might want to download images of pages for visual analysis. This notebook shows you how to get cover images, but could be easily modified to get another page, or a PDF. I used a modified version of this to create [a collection of 3,471 full page editorial cartoons](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#editorial-cartoons-from-the-bulletin-1886-to-1952) from _The Bulletin_, 1886 to 1952 – all available to download from CloudStor.\n* **[Get OCRd text from digitised books in Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-books/#harvesting-the-text-of-digitised-books-and-ephemera)** – Yep, there’s digitised books as well as newspapers and periodicals. You can download OCRd text from an individual book using the Trove web interface, but how do you make a collection of books without all that pointing and clicking? This notebook downloads all the available OCRd text from digitised books in Trove. The latest harvest includes [text from 26,762 works](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-books/#ocrd-text-from-trove-books-and-ephemera). You can explore the results [using this database](https://trove-digital-books.glitch.me/data/trove-digital-books).\n* **[Harvest parliamentary press releases from Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#harvest-parliament-press-releases-from-trove)** – Trove includes more than 380,000 press releases, speeches, and interview transcripts issued by Australian federal politicians and saved by the Parliamentary Library. This notebook shows you how to harvest both metadata and fulltext from a search of the parliamentary press releases. For example, here’s a collection of [politicians talking about ‘refugees’](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#politicians-talking-about-immigrants-and-refugees), and another [relating to COVID-19](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#politicians-talking-about-covid).\n* **[Harvest details of Radio National programs from Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-music/#harvest-abc-radio-national-records-from-trove)** – Trove creates records for programs broadcast on ABC Radio National, for the major current affairs programs these records at at segment level. Even though they don’t provide full transcripts, this data provide a rich, fine-grained record of Australia’s recent political, social, and economic history. This notebook shows you how to download the Radio National data. If you just want to dive straight in, there’s also a [pre-harvested collection](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-music/#abc-radio-national-programs) containing more than 400,000 records, with separate downloads for some of the main programs.\n* **[Find all the versions of an archived web page in Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#find-all-the-archived-versions-of-a-web-page)** – Many of the tools in the [Web Archives section](https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/) of the GLAM Workbench will work with the Australian Web Archive, which is part of Trove. This notebook shows you how to get data about the number of times a web page has been archived over time.\n* **[Harvesting collections of text from archived web pages in Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#harvesting-collections-of-text-from-archived-web-pages)** – If you want to explore how the content of a web page changes over time, you can use this notebook to capture the text content of every archived version of a web page.\n* **[Convert a Trove list into a CSV file](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#convert-a-trove-list-into-a-csv-file)** – While Trove provides a data download option for lists, it leaves out a lot of useful data. This notebook downloads full details of newspaper articles and other works in a list and saves them as CSV files. Like the Trove Newspaper Harvester, it lets you download OCRd text and images from newspaper articles.\n* **Collecting information about Trove user activity** – It’s not just the content of Trove that provides interesting research data, it’s also the way people engage with it. Using the Trove API it’s possible to harvest details of [all user created lists and tags](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/). And yes, there’s pre-harvested collections of [lists](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#trove-lists-metadata) and [tags](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#trove-public-tags) for the impatient.\n\nWhile I’m focusing here on Trove, there’s also tools to create datasets from the [National Archives of Australia](https://glam-workbench.net/recordsearch/), [Digital NZ and Papers Past](https://glam-workbench.net/digitalnz/), the [National Museum of Australia](https://glam-workbench.net/nma/) and more. And there’s a [big list of readily downloadable datasets](https://glam-workbench.net/glam-data-list/) from Australian GLAM organisations.\n\n## Visualisation and analysis\n\nMany of the notebooks listed above include examples that demonstrate ways of exploring and analysing your harvested data. There are also a number of companion notebooks that examine some possibilities in more detail, for example:\n\n* [Explore your Trove newspaper harvests](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/#exploring-your-troveharvester-data)\n* [Load your Trove newspaper harvest in Datasette](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/#display-the-results-of-a-harvest-as-a-searchable-database-using-datasette)\n* [Exploring ABC Radio National metadata](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-music/#exploring-abc-radio-national-metadata)\n* [Analyse public tags added to Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#analyse-public-tags-added-to-trove)\n\nBut there are also many other notebooks that demonstrate methods for analysing Trove’s content, for example:\n\n* **[QueryPic](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#querypic)** – Another tool that’s been around in different forms for a decade, QueryPic visualises searches in Trove’s newspapers. The latest web app couldn’t be simpler, just paste in your API key and a search url and create charts showing the number of matching articles over time. You can combine queries, change time scales, and download the data and visualisations. Interested to see how other researchers have used it? Here's a [Twitter thread with links to some publications](https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/08/30/some-research-projects.html).\n* **[Visualise Trove newspaper searches over time](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#visualise-trove-newspaper-searches-over-time)** – This is like a deconstructed version of QueryPic that walks you through the process of using Trove’s facets to assemble a dataset of results over time. It provide a lot of detail on the sorts of data available, and the questions we can ask of it.\n* **[Visualise the total number of newspaper articles in Trove by year and state](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#visualise-the-total-number-of-newspaper-articles-in-trove-by-year-and-state)** – This notebook uses a modified version of the code above to analyse the construction and context of Trove’s newspaper corpus itself. What are you actually searching? Meet the WWI effect and the copyright cliff of death! This is a great place to start if you want to get people thinking critically about digital resources are constructed.\n* **[Trove newspapers – number of issues per day, 1803–2020](https://glam-workbench.net/examples/trove_newspaper_issues_per_day.html)** – visualisation of the number of newspaper issues published **every day** in Trove.\n* **[Analyse rates of OCR correction](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#analyse-rates-of-ocr-correction)** – Some more meta-analysis of the Trove corpus itself, this time focusing on patterns of OCR correction by Trove users.\n* **[Identifying non-English language newspapers in Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#finding-non-english-newspapers-in-trove)** – There are a growing number of non-English language newspapers digitised in Trove. However, if you're only searching using English keywords, you might never know that they're there. This notebook analyses a sample of articles from every newspaper in Trove to identify non-English content.\n* **[Beyond the copyright cliff of death](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#beyond-the-copyright-cliff-of-death)** – Most of the newspaper articles on Trove were published before 1955, but there are some from the later period. This notebook helps you find out how many, and which newspapers they were published in.\n* **[Map Trove newspaper results by state](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#map-trove-newspaper-results-by-state)** – This notebook uses the Trove `state` facet to create a choropleth map that visualises the number of search results per state. \n* **[Map Trove newspaper results by place of publication](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#map-trove-newspaper-results-by-place-of-publication)** – This notebook uses the Trove `title` facet to find the number of results per newspaper, then merges the results with a dataset of geolocated newspapers to map where articles were published.\n* **[Compare two versions of an archived web page](https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#compare-two-versions-of-an-archived-web-page)** – This notebook demonstrates a number of different ways of comparing versions of archived web pages. Just choose a repository, enter a url, and select two dates to see comparisons based on: page metadata, basic statistics such as file size and number of words, numbers of internal and external links, cosine similarity of text, line by line differences in text or code, and screenshots.\n* **[Display changes in the text of an archived web page over time](https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#display-changes-in-the-text-of-an-archived-web-page-over-time)** – This web app gathers all the available versions of a web page and then visualises changes in its content between versions – what’s been added, removed, and changed?\n* **[Use screenshots to visualise change in a page over time](https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#using-screenshots-to-visualise-change-in-a-page-over-time)**– Create a series of full page screenshots of a web page over time, then assemble them into a time series.\n\nThere are also possibilities for using Trove data creatively. For example you can [create 'scissors and paste' messages from Trove newspaper articles](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#create-scissors-and-paste-messages-from-trove-newspaper-articles).\n\n## Documentation and examples\n\nAll the Trove notebooks in the GLAM Workbench help document the possibilities and limits of the Trove API. The examples above can be modified and reworked to suit different research interests. Some notebooks also explore particular aspects of the API, for example:\n\n* **[Trove API Introduction](https://glam-workbench.net/trove/)** – Some very basic examples of making requests and understanding results.\n* **[Today’s news yesterday](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#todays-news-yesterday)** – Uses the `date` index and the `firstpageseq` parameter to find articles from exactly 100 years ago that were published on the front page. It then selects one of the articles at random and downloads and displays an image of the front page.\n* **[The use of standard licences and rights statements in Trove image records](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-images/#the-use-of-standard-licences-and-rights-statements-in-trove-image-records)** – Version 2.1 of the Trove API introduced a new rights index that you can use to limit your search results to records that include one of a list of standard licences and rights statements. We can also use this index to build a picture of which rights statements are currently being used, and by who.\n* **[Random items from Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-random/)** – Changes to the Trove API meant that techniques you could previously use to select resources at random no longer work. This section documents some alternative ways of retrieving random-ish works and newspaper articles from Trove. \n\nAnd while it’s not officially part of the GLAM Workbench, I also maintain the [Trove API Console](https://troveconsole.herokuapp.com/) which provides lots of examples of the API in action.\n\n## Videos\n\nI've started making videos to help you get started with the GLAM Workbench.\n\n* [**GLAM Workbench – use QueryPic to visualise searches in Trove's digitised newspapers**](https://youtu.be/vdyKNowv9gw)\n* [**GLAM Workbench – use QueryPic to visualise searches in Trove's digitised newspapers (part 2)**](https://youtu.be/J_LgNL2EM4M)\n* [**GLAM Workbench – using the Trove Newspaper & Gazette Harvester (the web app version)**](https://youtu.be/WKFuJR6lLF4)\n\n## Datasets\n\nA number of pre-harvested datasets are noted above in the 'Getting and moving data' section.

These are openly-licensed and available for installation from PyPi.\n\n- [**Trove Harvester**](https://pypi.org/project/troveharvester/) – harvest newspaper and gazette articles\n- **[Trove Query Parser](https://pypi.org/project/trove-query-parser/)** – convert search parameters from the Trove web interface into a form the API understands\n- [**Trove Newspaper Images**](https://pypi.org/project/trove-newspaper-images/) – tools for downloading images from Trove's digitised newspapers and gazettes\n\n## Other tools and interfaces\n\nOver the years I've developed many tools and interfaces using Trove data. Some have been replaced by the GLAM Workbench, but others keep chugging along, for example:\n\n- **[Explore Trove's Digitised Journals](https://trove-titles.herokuapp.com/)** – a tool to help you browse, search, and explore Trove's digitised journals\n- **[Headline Roulette](https://headlineroulette.net/)** – a simple, customisable game using Trove newspapers\n- **[In a word...](https://inaword.herokuapp.com/)** – currents in Australian affairs, 2003–2013, using data from ABC Radio National\n- **[Trove API Console](https://troveconsole.herokuapp.com/)** – use this to learn how to construct API queries\n- **[Trove Traces](https://www.timsherratt.org/shed/trovetraces/traces/index.html)** – archived version of a 2014 experiment to see who was citing Trove newspapers\n- [**@TroveNewsBot**](http://twitter.com/trovenewsbot) – unlike most GLAM Twitter bots, @TroveNewsBot doesn't just tweet random stuff, you can use it to search Trove from Twitter, see the [full operating instructions](https://wragge.github.io/trovenewsbot2019/).\n- [**Trove Places**](https://troveplaces.herokuapp.com/) – click on a map to find Trove newspapers by place\n- [**Trove Zotero Translator**](https://ozglam.chat/t/capturing-trove-newspaper-articles-with-zotero/21) – lets you capture metadata, OCRd text, and a PDF from an article in Trove newspapers, installed as part of [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).\n- **[Keyboard shortcuts for Trove newspapers](https://ozglam.chat/t/easy-browsing-of-trove-newspapers-with-these-keyboard-shortcuts/105)** – this userscript activates your arrow keys to help you navigate newspapers by page and issue.\n\nSee also [More GLAM tools and interfaces](https://glam-workbench.net/glam-tools-interfaces/) in the GLAM Workbench. #dhhacks\n\n",

As well as the number of articles by [year](https://github.com/wragge/trove-newspaper-totals/blob/master/data/total_articles_by_year.csv) and [state](https://github.com/wragge/trove-newspaper-totals/blob/master/data/total_articles_by_year_and_state.csv), it also harvests the number of articles by [newspaper](https://github.com/wragge/trove-newspaper-totals/blob/master/data/total_articles_by_newspaper.csv) and [category](https://github.com/wragge/trove-newspaper-totals/blob/master/data/total_articles_by_category.csv). As mentioned, these four datasets are updated weekly. If you want to get all the changes over time, you can retrieve earlier versions from the repository's commit history. \r\n\r\nAll the datasets are CC-0 licensed and validated with Frictionless.\r\n\r\nThere's also a [notebook in the GLAM Workbench](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#visualise-the-total-number-of-newspaper-articles-in-trove-by-year-and-state) that explores this sort of data.\n",

alt=\"\" />\n</figure>\n<p>Zotero extracts information from a web site using a variety of 'translators'. Some of these translators look for generic information embedded in a web page, such as &lt;TITLE&gt; and &lt;META&gt; tags. Others are written to work with widely-used software systems, such as library catalogues. For bespoke systems, custom translators can be created to extract the necessary data. But sometimes, the data just isn't available in a form Zotero can access.</p>\n<p>\n  So in the results spreadsheet you'll notice that the National Archives of Australia's RecordSearch database works with Zotero. This is because I created a <a href=\"https://ozglam.chat/t/zotero-translator-for-recordsearch-updated/27\">custom translator</a> for it many years ago. There's also a <a href=\"https://ozglam.chat/t/capturing-trove-newspaper-articles-with-zotero/21\">custom translator</a> for Trove's digitised newspapers, but the translator for other parts of Trove was broken by the site's upgrade in 2020. \n  <br />\n</p>\n<p>\n  A number of the results note that Zotero support is 'limited'. This usually means that Zotero can get a title and a url, and maybe a description. This basic metadata is often embedded in pages for use by social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, but Zotero can also grab it. The absolute very least you might expect from a GLAM organisation is to make sure this sort of basic metadata is embedded in every page, but as you can see by all the red in the results table, even this is missing from many online collections. Libraries used to champion the use of <a href=\"https://dublincore.org/\">Dublin Core</a> metadata in web pages, and Australian government agencies were expected to make use of <a href=\"https://agls.gov.au/\">AGLS</a> to aid web discovery. But it seems these are no longer priorities.\n  <br />\n</p>\n<p>The good news is we can fix this, either by supporting and encouraging GLAM organisations to embed useful metadata, or by creating custom translators. There's been a lot of talk about HASS research infrastructure over the last six months, and it seems to me that some integration and cooperation in this area would make a big difference to the way researchers work with GLAM collections.</p>\n<p>\n  There's an <a href=\"https://forms.gle/D97jrZvRXCsJVoDh6\">online form</a> available if you'd like to contribute new results to the spreadsheet, or update existing details.\n  <br />\n</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I regularly update the Python packages used in the different sections of the <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/\">GLAM Workbench</a>; though probably not as often as I should. Part of the problem is that once I've updated the packages, I have to run all the notebooks to make sure I haven't inadvertently broken something -- and this takes time. And in those cases where the notebooks need an API key to run, I have to copy and paste the key in at the appropriate spots, then remember to delete them afterwords. They're little niggles, but they add up, particularly as the GLAM Workbench itself expands.</p>\n<p>I've been looking around at Jupyter notebook automated testing options for a while. There's <a href=\"https://github.com/treebeardtech/nbmake\">nbmake</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/nteract/testbook\">testbook</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/computationalmodelling/nbval\">nbval</a>, as well as custom solutions involving things like <a href=\"https://github.com/nteract/papermill\">papermill</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert\">nbconvert</a>. After much wavering, I finally decided to give `nbval` a go. The thing that I like about `nbval` is that I can start simple, then increase the complexity of my testing as required. The `--nbval-lax` option just checks to make sure that all the cells in a notebook run without generating exceptions. You can also tag individual cells that you want to exclude from testing. This gives me a testing baseline -- this notebook runs without errors -- it might not do exactly what I think it's doing, but at least it's not exploding in flames. Working from this baseline, I can start tagging individual cells where I want the output of the cell to be checked. This will let me test whether a cell is doing what it's supposed to.</p>\n<p>This approach means that I can start testing without making major changes to existing notebooks. The main thing I had to think about is how to handle API keys or other variables which are manually set by users. I decided the easiest approach was to store them in a `.env` file and use <a href=\"https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv\">dotenv</a> to load them within the notebook. This also makes it easy for users to save their own credentials and use them across multiple notebooks -- no more cutting and pasting of keys! Some notebooks are designed to run as web apps using Voila, so they expect human interaction. In these cases, I added extra cells that only run in the testing environment -- they populate the necessary fields and simulate button clicks to start.</p>\n<p>While I was in a QA frame of mind, I also started playing with <a href=\"https://github.com/nbQA-dev/nbQA\">nbqa</a> -- a framework for all sorts of code formatting, linting, and checking tools. I decided I'd try to standardise the formatting of my notebook code by running <a href=\"https://github.com/PyCQA/isort\">isort</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/psf/black\">black</a>, and <a href=\"https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/\">flake8</a>. As well ask making the code cleaner and more readable, they pick up things like unused imports or variables. To further automate this process, I configured the `nbqa` checks to run when I try to commit any notebook code changes using `git`. This was made easy by the <a href=\"https://pre-commit.com/\">pre-commit</a> package.</p>\n<p>This is all set up and running in the <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/\">Trove newspapers</a> repository -- you can <a href=\"https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/trove-newspapers/releases/tag/v1.3.0\">see the changes here</a>. Now if I update the Python packages or make any other changes to the repository, I can just run `pytest --nbval-lax` to test <b>every</b> notebook at once. And if I make changes to an individual notebook, `nbqa` will automatically give the changes a code quality check before I save them to the repository. I'm planning to roll these changes out across the whole of the GLAM Workbench in coming months.</p>\n<p>\n  Developments like these are not very exciting for users, but they're important for the management and sustainability of the GLAM Workbench, and help create a solid foundation for future development and collaboration. Last year I created a <a href=\"https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/11/11/a-template-for.html\">GLAM Workbench repository template</a> to help people or organisations thinking about contributing new sections. I can now add these testing and QA steps into the template to further share and standardise the work of developing the GLAM Workbench.\n  <br />\n</p>\n",

				"title": "More thoughts on the Trove researcher platform for advanced research",
				"content_html": "<p>Previously on ‘What could we do with $2.3 million?’, the National Library of Australia produced a <a href=\"https://ardc.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Research_Platform_TROVE.pdf\">draft plan</a> for an ‘Advanced Researcher Platform’ that was <a href=\"https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/09/10/some-thoughts-on.html\">thoroughly inadequate</a>. Rather than submit this plan to the <a href=\"https://ardc.edu.au/\">ARDC</a> for consideration as part of the <a href=\"https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/strategic-activities/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/\">HASS RDC process</a>, the NLA wisely decided to make some fundamental changes. The <a href=\"https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/strategic-activities/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/project-plans/trove-researcher-platform-for-advanced-research-project-plan/\">redrafted draft</a> is now available for re-feedback. This is where we pick up the story…</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-what-has-changed\">So what has changed?</h2>\n<p>Generally speaking there seem to be two major changes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There’s a much greater focus on consultation and collaboration.</li>\n<li>There’s less detail about what will actually be developed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These two changes can work together positively. The details of what’s being developed can be worked out through consultation, ensuring that what’s developed meets real research needs. But this assumes first that the consultation process is effective, and second that the overall scope of the project is appropriate. I’m not convinced on either of these two fronts.</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR – it’s better than it was, but the hand waving around collaboration and integration aren’t convincing, the scope needs rethinking, and I still can’t see how what’s proposed provides good value for money.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"consultation\">Consultation</h2>\n<p>Given that there was almost no space for consultation in the previous draft, this version could only do better. There’s certainly lots of talk about consulting with the HASS community, and a new governance structure that includes researcher representatives, but what will the consultation process actually deliver?</p>\n<p>The NLA is now partnering with the ANU (why the ANU? because it’s closest?), and the ANU will apparently be driving the consultation process. The whole process is complex and weirdly hierarchical. Any HASS researcher can participate in the initial rounds, but their numbers dwindle as you move up the hierarchy, until you reach the Project Board where only researchers with specific institutional affiliations are admitted. I’m imagining a Hunger Games scenario…</p>\n<p>The process aims to gather feedback on ‘what developments would offer the best assistance to the majority and be feasibly achieved within the project timeframe’. That sounds ok, but earlier in the document the outcome of the consultation process is described in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The outcome will be expressed as one (or potentially two) goals articulated in high level requirements document(s) and align to the objectives as described in this project plan. Indicative goals might include: a graph visualising occurrence of keywords over time; an interface visualising place of publication as geospatial data on a map; or, or a concordance for exploring textual data such as with key word in context.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So all of this complex, hierarchical consultative structure is just to decide whether we have a line graph or a map (or both if we’re really lucky)? If you look at the project deliverables, it seems that the researcher feedback funnels into Deliverable 6 in Work Package 3 – ‘Analysing and visualising research data’. But what about the rest of the project? Will researcher feedback have any role in determining how datasets are created, for example?</p>\n<p>I suppose even this very limited consultation is better than what was previously proposed (ie. nothing). But what then happens to the feedback from researchers? An Advisory Panel will be selected (by whom?) to collate the ideas and produce the high-level requirements. Detailed requirements will be generated from the high-level requirements (don’t you just love project management speak?), and then subjected to the argy bargy of the MoSCoW process where priorities will be set. It’s likely that these priorities will be whittled down further as development proceeds. These are crucial decision-making stages where important ideas can be relegated to the ‘nice to have’ category and never heard of again. It’s not clear from the plan who is involved in this, and where the final decision-making power lies.</p>\n<p>Of course, some of these details can be worked out later. But given that the big sell of this version of the plan is the expanded consultative process, I think it’s important to know where the power really lies. What role will researchers actually play in determining the outcomes of the project? This is not at all clear.</p>\n<h2 id=\"scope\">Scope</h2>\n<p>But what <em>is</em> the project? In general terms it hasn’t really changed. There will be some sort of portal where researchers can create and share datasets and visualisations. Crucially, it’s assumed that this portal will be part of Trove itself. As noted the last time round, the original project description provided by the government made no such assumption. It was focused on ’the delivery of researcher portals accessible through Trove’. The NLA has interpreted ‘through’ to mean ‘as part of’, and given the limits on the consultative process described above it seems this won’t change.</p>\n<p>Or will it? I’m still puzzling over a few sections in the plan that talk about looking beyond the NLA to see whether there are existing options to meet user requirements. Deliverable 2 in Work Package 2 will:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Undertake an environmental scan for current research usage and tools such as (Glam Workbench) and a market scan to determine if these gaps can be filled by existing services that the HASS community and/or Trove support.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What’s with the weird brackets around ‘Glam Workbench’? Makes me think it was a last minute addition. I suppose I should be grateful that the NLA wants to spend some money to confirm that the <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/\">GLAM Workbench</a> actually exists. But then what? The next deliverable will:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>determine which requirements will be delivered within the Trove Platform and which will be outsourced to other services.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So if the <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/\">Trove Newspaper Harvester</a>, for example, meets one of the requirements, will Trove simply link to it? Imagine that, Trove actually linking to one of the dozens of Trove tools and resources provided by the <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/\">GLAM Workbench</a>. Oh frabjous day! But then does the NLA still get the money to develop the thing that I’ve already developed, or will they share some of the project money with me (yeah right)? I really have no idea what’s envisaged here. How will the ‘solution architecture’ integrate existing tools and services? And what does that mean for the resourcing of the project as a whole?</p>\n<p>Elsewhere the plan talks about services ‘dedicated specifically to Trove collections and/or to the Australian research community’ that could be ‘“plugged in”’ to the platform ecosystem’. That sounds hopeful, but if the platform is an ecosystem of tools and services from the NLA and beyond, then that changes the scope of the project completely. Why not start with that? Start with the idea of developing an ecosystem of tools and services making use of Trove data, rather than just developing a new Trove interface. Then we could work together to build something really useful.</p>\n<p>It just seems that the scope of the project as a whole hasn’t been properly thought through. The original plan has been expanded in vague, hand wavy directions, without thinking through the implications and possibilities of that expansion. Tinkering around the edges isn’t enough, the nature of this project needs to be completely rethought.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wheres-the-strategy\">Where’s the strategy?</h2>\n<p>Rather than have an open call for project funding, the HASS RDC process has focused instead on making strategic investments. But where’s the strategy? The current projects were identified through a number of scoping studies undertaken by the Department of Education, Skills, and Employment. But these scoping studies haven’t been publicly released, so we don’t really know why these projects were recommended for funding. Is giving the NLA buckets of money to develop a new interface really what was envisaged? Surely if you were thinking strategically, you’d be considering ways in which the rich data asset represented by Trove could be opened to new research uses. You’d look around at existing tools and resources and think about how they could be leveraged. You’d examine limitations in the delivery of Trove data, and think about what sort of plumbing was needed to connect up new and existing projects. So how did we end up here?</p>\n<p><strong>Perhaps we just need to take a step back and recognise that just because Trove provides the data, doesn’t mean it should direct the project.</strong> There needs to be another layer of strategic planning which identifies the necessary components and directs resources accordingly. As I <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/wragge/cf8eb2309f89b36d8d37402621d1a3b4\">noted before</a>, there’s plenty of ways in which Trove’s data and APIs could be improved. Give them money to do that. But should they be building tools for researchers to use that data? Nope. Absolutely not.</p>\n<p>I attended the eResearch Australasia Conference recently, and was really impressed with all the activity around research software development. If the tool building component of this project was opened up, it could provide a really useful focus for developing collaboration across the research software community and building capacities and understanding in HASS. It would also encourage greater reuse and integration. This would seems to be a much more strategic intervention.</p>\n<h2 id=\"assorted-questions\">Assorted questions</h2>\n<p>I’m not going to go through the plan in detail again. I’ve already spent a couple of weeks engaged in, or worrying about, the HASS RDC process. I’m tired, and I’m frustrated, and I can’t shake the depressing thought that the NLA will end up being rewarded for its bad behaviour. Many of my <a href=\"https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/09/10/some-thoughts-on.html\">comments on the earlier draft</a> still apply, particularly those around the API and the development of pathways for researchers.</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting, however, that the ’sustainability’ section of the plan has disappeared completely – perhaps not surprisingly, as the only suggestion last time was for someone to give them more money. There are gestures towards integration, such as including representatives of the other HASS RDC projects on the Trove Project Board. But real integration would happen through technical interchange, not governance structures, and there’s no plan for that.</p>\n<p>I’m also a bit confused about the role of ANU. It seems to be mostly focused on consultation, but then there are statements like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The development phase will be completed as a collaboration between the ANU and NLA, with both institutions working on the development of their own systems to align the with the product goals and Trove.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What ANU systems are we talking about here? And why are they part of the project?</p>\n<p>A couple of objectives were also added to the plan:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>‘Explore opportunities to enrich the Trove corpus’ – sounds good, but it’s not picked up anywhere else in the plan, and has no deliverables associated with it. Is it just window dressing?</li>\n<li>‘Develop Trove’s HASS community relationships and engagement capabilities’ – sorry if I’m cynical, but when your first plan doesn’t even bother to consult the HASS community, when you don’t even link to existing resources in the sector, why should we believe that this will now be an important, ongoing objective?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the issue of community relationships, a few people in the previous round of feedback indicated to me that they didn’t want to criticise the NLA too harshly because they might want to work with them in the future. That’s not healthy community building.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>After two attempts, the NLA has still not delivered a coherent project plan that demonstrates real value to the HASS sector and meets the ARDC’s assessment criteria.

				"content_text": "Previously on ‘What could we do with $2.3 million?’, the National Library of Australia produced a [draft plan](https://ardc.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Research_Platform_TROVE.pdf) for an ‘Advanced Researcher Platform’ that was [thoroughly inadequate](https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/09/10/some-thoughts-on.html). Rather than submit this plan to the [ARDC](https://ardc.edu.au/) for consideration as part of the [HASS RDC process](https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/strategic-activities/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/), the NLA wisely decided to make some fundamental changes. The [redrafted draft](https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/strategic-activities/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/project-plans/trove-researcher-platform-for-advanced-research-project-plan/) is now available for re-feedback. This is where we pick up the story…\n\n## So what has changed?\nGenerally speaking there seem to be two major changes.\n\n* There’s a much greater focus on consultation and collaboration.\n* There’s less detail about what will actually be developed.\n\nThese two changes can work together positively. The details of what’s being developed can be worked out through consultation, ensuring that what’s developed meets real research needs. But this assumes first that the consultation process is effective, and second that the overall scope of the project is appropriate. I’m not convinced on either of these two fronts. \n\n**TL;DR – it’s better than it was, but the hand waving around collaboration and integration aren’t convincing, the scope needs rethinking, and I still can’t see how what’s proposed provides good value for money.**\n\n## Consultation\nGiven that there was almost no space for consultation in the previous draft, this version could only do better. There’s certainly lots of talk about consulting with the HASS community, and a new governance structure that includes researcher representatives, but what will the consultation process actually deliver?\n\nThe NLA is now partnering with the ANU (why the ANU? because it’s closest?), and the ANU will apparently be driving the consultation process. The whole process is complex and weirdly hierarchical. Any HASS researcher can participate in the initial rounds, but their numbers dwindle as you move up the hierarchy, until you reach the Project Board where only researchers with specific institutional affiliations are admitted. I’m imagining a Hunger Games scenario…\n\nThe process aims to gather feedback on ‘what developments would offer the best assistance to the majority and be feasibly achieved within the project timeframe’. That sounds ok, but earlier in the document the outcome of the consultation process is described in the following way:\n\n>  The outcome will be expressed as one (or potentially two) goals articulated in high level requirements document(s) and align to the objectives as described in this project plan. Indicative goals might include: a graph visualising occurrence of keywords over time; an interface visualising place of publication as geospatial data on a map; or, or a concordance for exploring textual data such as with key word in context.\n\nSo all of this complex, hierarchical consultative structure is just to decide whether we have a line graph or a map (or both if we’re really lucky)? If you look at the project deliverables, it seems that the researcher feedback funnels into Deliverable 6 in Work Package 3 – ‘Analysing and visualising research data’. But what about the rest of the project? Will researcher feedback have any role in determining how datasets are created, for example? \n\nI suppose even this very limited consultation is better than what was previously proposed (ie. nothing). But what then happens to the feedback from researchers? An Advisory Panel will be selected (by whom?) to collate the ideas and produce the high-level requirements. Detailed requirements will be generated from the high-level requirements (don’t you just love project management speak?), and then subjected to the argy bargy of the MoSCoW process where priorities will be set. It’s likely that these priorities will be whittled down further as development proceeds. These are crucial decision-making stages where important ideas can be relegated to the ‘nice to have’ category and never heard of again. It’s not clear from the plan who is involved in this, and where the final decision-making power lies. \n\nOf course, some of these details can be worked out later. But given that the big sell of this version of the plan is the expanded consultative process, I think it’s important to know where the power really lies. What role will researchers actually play in determining the outcomes of the project? This is not at all clear.\n\n## Scope\nBut what *is* the project? In general terms it hasn’t really changed. There will be some sort of portal where researchers can create and share datasets and visualisations. Crucially, it’s assumed that this portal will be part of Trove itself. As noted the last time round, the original project description provided by the government made no such assumption. It was focused on ’the delivery of researcher portals accessible through Trove’. The NLA has interpreted ‘through’ to mean ‘as part of’, and given the limits on the consultative process described above it seems this won’t change.\n\nOr will it? I’m still puzzling over a few sections in the plan that talk about looking beyond the NLA to see whether there are existing options to meet user requirements. Deliverable 2 in Work Package 2 will:\n\n>  Undertake an environmental scan for current research usage and tools such as (Glam Workbench) and a market scan to determine if these gaps can be filled by existing services that the HASS community and/or Trove support.\n\nWhat’s with the weird brackets around ‘Glam Workbench’? Makes me think it was a last minute addition. I suppose I should be grateful that the NLA wants to spend some money to confirm that the [GLAM Workbench](https://glam-workbench.net/) actually exists. But then what? The next deliverable will:\n\n> determine which requirements will be delivered within the Trove Platform and which will be outsourced to other services.\n\nSo if the [Trove Newspaper Harvester](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/), for example, meets one of the requirements, will Trove simply link to it? Imagine that, Trove actually linking to one of the dozens of Trove tools and resources provided by the [GLAM Workbench](https://glam-workbench.net/). Oh frabjous day! But then does the NLA still get the money to develop the thing that I’ve already developed, or will they share some of the project money with me (yeah right)? I really have no idea what’s envisaged here. How will the ‘solution architecture’ integrate existing tools and services? And what does that mean for the resourcing of the project as a whole? \n\nElsewhere the plan talks about services ‘dedicated specifically to Trove collections and/or to the Australian research community’ that could be ‘“plugged in”’ to the platform ecosystem’. That sounds hopeful, but if the platform is an ecosystem of tools and services from the NLA and beyond, then that changes the scope of the project completely. Why not start with that? Start with the idea of developing an ecosystem of tools and services making use of Trove data, rather than just developing a new Trove interface. Then we could work together to build something really useful.\n\nIt just seems that the scope of the project as a whole hasn’t been properly thought through. The original plan has been expanded in vague, hand wavy directions, without thinking through the implications and possibilities of that expansion. Tinkering around the edges isn’t enough, the nature of this project needs to be completely rethought.\n\n## Where’s the strategy?\nRather than have an open call for project funding, the HASS RDC process has focused instead on making strategic investments. But where’s the strategy? The current projects were identified through a number of scoping studies undertaken by the Department of Education, Skills, and Employment. But these scoping studies haven’t been publicly released, so we don’t really know why these projects were recommended for funding. Is giving the NLA buckets of money to develop a new interface really what was envisaged? Surely if you were thinking strategically, you’d be considering ways in which the rich data asset represented by Trove could be opened to new research uses. You’d look around at existing tools and resources and think about how they could be leveraged. You’d examine limitations in the delivery of Trove data, and think about what sort of plumbing was needed to connect up new and existing projects. So how did we end up here?\n\n**Perhaps we just need to take a step back and recognise that just because Trove provides the data, doesn’t mean it should direct the project.** There needs to be another layer of strategic planning which identifies the necessary components and directs resources accordingly. As I [noted before](https://gist.github.com/wragge/cf8eb2309f89b36d8d37402621d1a3b4), there’s plenty of ways in which Trove’s data and APIs could be improved. Give them money to do that. But should they be building tools for researchers to use that data? Nope. Absolutely not.\n\nI attended the eResearch Australasia Conference recently, and was really impressed with all the activity around research software development. If the tool building component of this project was opened up, it could provide a really useful focus for developing collaboration across the research software community and building capacities and understanding in HASS. It would also encourage greater reuse and integration. This would seems to be a much more strategic intervention.\n\n## Assorted questions\nI’m not going to go through the plan in detail again. I’ve already spent a couple of weeks engaged in, or worrying about, the HASS RDC process. I’m tired, and I’m frustrated, and I can’t shake the depressing thought that the NLA will end up being rewarded for its bad behaviour. Many of my [comments on the earlier draft](https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/09/10/some-thoughts-on.html) still apply, particularly those around the API and the development of pathways for researchers.\n\nIt’s worth noting, however, that the ’sustainability’ section of the plan has disappeared completely – perhaps not surprisingly, as the only suggestion last time was for someone to give them more money.

But it shouldn’t be funded to do everything.\n\nIn the end, we could do so much better, and so much more…\n\n## Have your say…\nYou can provide your own feedback on the new draft plan.

It’s basically a collection of Jupyter notebooks, and those notebooks can be used within a variety of different environments. This helps make the GLAM Workbench more sustainable – new components can be swapped in and out as required. It also makes it possible to create different pathways for users, depending on their digital skills, institutional support, and research needs. For example, links to [Binder](https://glam-workbench.net/using-binder/) make it easy for users to explore the possibilities of the GLAM Workbench and accomplish quick tasks. But Binder has limits. Where do you go when your research project scales up?\n\nEarlier this year I added one-click installation of GLAM Workbench repositories in [Reclaim Cloud](https://glam-workbench.net/using-reclaim-cloud/). **Today I’m very pleased to announce that selected GLAM Workbench repositories can be installed as applications within the [Nectar Research Cloud](https://ardc.edu.au/services/nectar-research-cloud/).** Using nationally-funded digital infrastructure, researchers in Australian universities can now create their own workbenches in minutes. So whether you’re harvesting truckloads of data from Trove or analysing web archives at scale, you can move beyond Binder and set up an environment dedicated to your research project. Cool huh?\n\n![You can install GLAM Workbench repositories using this simple application in Nectar!](https://updates.timsherratt.org/uploads/2021/e10ef8218a.png)\n\nCurrently four repositories can be installed on Nectar in this way:\n\n* [Trove newspapers](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/)\n* [Trove newspaper and gazette harvester](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/)\n* [Recordsearch](https://glam-workbench.net/recordsearch/) (National Archives of Australia)\n* [Web archives](https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/)\n\nBut more will be added in the future as I update repositories to generate the necessary Docker images. Nectar installation information is now included in each of these four repositories, and I’ve added a [Using the Nectar Cloud](https://glam-workbench.net/using-nectar/) section to the help documentation that includes a detailed walkthrough of the installation process. If you strike any problems either [raise an issue](https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/glam-workbench.github.io/issues) on GitHub, or ask a question at [OzGLAM Chat](https://ozglam.chat/c/glam-workbench/8).\n\n**Huge thanks to Andy, Jacob, and Jo** at the [Australian Research Data Commons](https://ardc.edu.au/) (ARDC) who responded enthusiastically to my tweeted query, and packaged the repositories up into an easy-to-install, [reusable application](https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/murano-glamworkbench).

				"title": "Some thoughts on the ‘Trove Researcher Platform for Advanced Research’ draft plan",
				"content_html": "<p>Late last year the Federal Government <a href=\"https://ministers.dese.gov.au/tehan/improving-hass-and-indigenous-research-infrastructure\">announced</a> it was making an $8.9 million investment in HASS and Indigenous research infrastructure. This program is being managed by the ARDC and will lead to the development of a <a href=\"https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/strategic-activities/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/\">HASS Research Data Commons</a>. According to the ARDC, a research data commons:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>brings together people, skills, data, and related resources such as storage, compute, software, and models to enable researchers to conduct world class data-intensive research</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sounds awesome!</p>\n<p>Based on scoping studies commissioned by the Department of Education, Skills, and Employment (which have not yet been made public), <a href=\"https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/strategic-activities/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/recommendations-for-co-investment-in-humanities-arts-and-social-sciences-research-data-commons-program/\">four activities were selected for initial funding</a> under this program. Draft project plans for these four activities have now been <a href=\"https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/strategic-activities/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/project-plans/\">released for public comment</a>.</p>\n<p>One of these activities aims to develop a ’Trove researcher platform for advanced research’:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Augmenting existing National Library of Australia resources, this platform will enable a focus on the delivery of researcher portals accessible through Trove, Australia’s unique public heritage site. The platform will create tools for visualisation, entity recognition, transcription and geocoding across Trove content and other corpora.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://ardc.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Research_Platform_TROVE.pdf\">download the draft project plan</a> for the Trove platform. Funding for this activity will be capped at $2,301,185 across 2021-23. In this post I’ll try to pull together some of my own thoughts on this plan.</p>\n<p>I suppose I’d better start with a disclaimer – I’m not a neutral observer in this. I started scraping data from Trove newspapers way back in 2010, building the first versions of tools like QueryPic and the Trove Newspaper Harvester. While I was manager of Trove, from 2013 to 2016, I argued for recognition of Trove as a key part of Australia’s humanities research infrastructure, and highlighted possible research uses of Trove data available through the API. Since then I’ve worked to bring a range of digital tools, examples, tutorials, and hacks together for researchers in the <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/\">GLAM Workbench</a> – a <a href=\"https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/08/26/glam-workbench-a.html\">large number of these</a> work with data from Trove.</p>\n<p>I strongly believe that Trove should receive ongoing funding through <a href=\"https://www.dese.gov.au/ncris\">NCRIS</a> as a piece of national research infrastructure. Unfortunately though, the draft project plan does not make a strong case for investment – it’s vague, unimaginative, and makes little attempt to integrate with existing tools and services. I think it scores poorly against the ARDC’s <a href=\"https://ardc.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Evaluation-Criteria-HASS-RDC-and-Indigenous-Research-Capability-program.pdf\">evaluation criteria</a>, and doesn’t seem to offer good value for money. As someone who has championed the use of Trove data for research across the last decade, I’m very disappointed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-planned\">What’s planned?</h2>\n<p>So what is being proposed? There seems to be three main components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Authenticated ‘project’ spaces for researchers where datasets relating to a particular research topic can be stored</li>\n<li>The ability to create custom datasets from a search in Trove</li>\n<li>Tools to visualise stored datasets.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There’s no doubt that these are all useful functions for researchers, but many problems arise when we look at how they’re going to be implemented.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-authenticated-project-spaces\">1. Authenticated project spaces</h3>\n<p>The draft plan indicates that authentication of users through the <a href=\"https://aaf.edu.au/\">Australian Access Federation</a> is preferred. Why? Trove already has a system for the creation of user accounts. Using AAF would limit use of the new platform to those attached to universities or research agencies. I don’t understand what the use of AAF adds to the project, except perhaps to provide an example of integration with existing infrastructure services.</p>\n<p>The plan notes that project spaces could be ‘public’ or ‘private’. Presumably a ‘public’ space would give access to stored datasets, but what sort of access controls would be available in relation to individual datasets? It’s also noted (Deliverable 7) that researchers would have ‘an option to “publish” their research findings for public consumption‘. Does this mean datasets and visualisations would be assigned a DOI (or other persistent identifier) and preserved indefinitely? How might these spaces integrate with existing data repositories?</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-create-custom-datasets\">2. Create custom datasets</h3>\n<p>The lack of detail in the plan makes it difficult to assess what’s being proposed here. But it seems that users would be able to construct a search using the Trove web interface (or a new search interface?) and save the results as a dataset.</p>\n<p>What data would be searched? It’s not clear, but in reference to the visualisations it’s stated that data would come from ’Trove’s existing full text collections (newspapers and gazettes, magazines and newsletters, books)’. So no web archives, and no metadata from any of Trove’s aggregated collections (even without full text, collection metadata can create interesting research possibilities, see for example the <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-music/\">Radio National records</a> in the GLAM Workbench).</p>\n<p>What will be included in each dataset? There’s few details, but at a minimum you’d expect something like a CSV containing the metadata of all the matching records, and files containing the full text content of the items. These could potentially be <em>very</em> large. There’s no indication about how storage and processing demands would be managed, but presumably there would be some per user, or per project, limits.</p>\n<p>Deliverable 8, ‘Data and visual download’, states that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All query results must be available as downloadable files, this would include CSV, JSON and XML for the query results list.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But there’s no mention of the full text content at all. Will it be included in downloadable datasets?</p>\n<p>As well as the record metadata and full text, you’d want there to be some metadata captured about the dataset itself – the search query used, when it was captured, the number of records, etc. To support integration and reuse, it would be good to align this with something like <a href=\"https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/\">RO Crate</a>.</p>\n<p>How will searches be constructed? It’s not clear if this will be integrated with the existing search interface, or be something completely separate; however, the plan does note that ‘limitations are put onto the dataset like keyword search terms and filters corresponding to the filters currently available in the interface’. So it seems that the new platform will be using the existing search indexes. It’s obviously important for the relationship between existing search functions and the new dataset creation tool to be explicit and transparent so that researchers understand what they’re getting.</p>\n<p>It’s also worth noting that changes to the search interface last year removed some useful options from the advanced search form. In particular, you can no longer exclude matches in tags or comments. If you’re a researcher looking for the occurrence of a particular word, you generally don’t want to include records where that word only appears in a user added tag (I have a story about ‘Word War I’ that illustrates this!).</p>\n<p>This raises a broader issue. There doesn’t seem to be any mention in the project plan of work to improve the metadata and indexing in response to research needs. Even just identifying digitised books in the current web interface can be a bit of a challenge, and digitised books and periodicals can be grouped into work records with other versions. We need to recognise that the needs of discovery sometimes compromise specific research uses.</p>\n<p>I’m trying to be constructive in my responses here, but at this point I just have to scream – WHAT ABOUT THE <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/\">TROVE NEWSPAPER HARVESTER</a>? A tool has existed for <em>ten years</em> that lets users create a dataset containing metadata and full text from a search in Trove’s newspapers and gazettes. I’ve spent a lot of time over recent years adding features and making it easier to use. Now you can download not only full text, but also PDFs and images of articles. The latest web app version in the GLAM Workbench runs in the cloud. Just one click to start it up, then all you need to do is paste in your Trove API key and the url of your search. It can’t get much easier.</p>\n<p>The GLAM Workbench also includes tools to create datasets and download OCRd text from Trove’s <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-books/\">books</a> and digitised <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/\">journals</a>. These are still in notebook form, so are not as easy to use, but I have created pre-harvested datasets of all books and periodicals with OCRd text, and stored them on CloudStor. What’s missing at the moment is something to harvest a collection of journal articles, but this would not be difficult. As an added bonus, the GLAM Workbench has tools to <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#harvesting-collections-of-text-from-archived-web-pages\">create full text datasets</a> from the Australian Web Archive.</p>\n<p>So what is this project really adding? And why is there no attempt to leverage existing tools and resources?</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-visualise-datasets\">3. Visualise datasets</h3>\n<p>Again, there’s a fair bit of hand waving in the plan, but it seems that users will be able to select a stored dataset and then choose a form of visualisation. The plan says that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An initial pilot would allow users to create line graphs that plot the frequency of a search term over time and maps that display results based on state-level geolocation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Up to three additional visualisations would be created later based on research feedback. It’s not clear which researchers will be consulted and when their feedback will be sought.</p>\n<p>The value of these sorts of visualisations is obviously dependent on the quality and consistency of the metadata. There’s nothing built into this plan that would, for example, allow a researcher to clean or normalise any of the saved data. You have to take what you’re given. The newspaper metadata is generally consistent, but books and periodicals less so.</p>\n<p>It’s also important to clarify what’s meant by ‘the frequency of a search term over time’. Does this mean the number of records matching a search term, or the number of times that the search term actually appears in the full text of all matched records? If the latter, then this <em>would</em> be a major enrichment of the available data. Though if this data was available it should be pushed through the API and/or made available as a downloadable dataset for integration with other platforms (perhaps along the lines of the Hathi Trust’s <a href=\"https://analytics.hathitrust.org/datasets\">Extracted Features Dataset</a>). I suspect, however, that what is actually meant is the number of matching search results.</p>\n<p>Again, the value of any geospatial visualisation depends on what is actually being visualised! The <code>state</code> facet in newspapers indicates place of publication, it’s not clear what the <code>place</code> facet in other categories represents. For this sort of visualisation to be useful in a research context, there would need to be some explanation of how these values were created, and any gaps or uncertainties.</p>\n<p>Time for another scream of frustration — WHAT ABOUT <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#querypic\">QUERYPIC</a>? Another long-standing tool which has already been <a href=\"https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/08/30/some-research-projects.html\">cited a number of times</a> in research literature. <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#querypic\">QueryPic</a> visualises searches in Trove’s newspapers and gazettes over time. You can adjust time scales and intervals, and download the results as images, a CSV file, and an HTML page. The project plan makes a point of claiming that its tools would not require any coding, but neither does QueryPic. Just plug in an API key and a search URL. I even made <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAclcciEeCD2z2BWQ2r3xD_Q8c05HppfP\">some videos</a> about it! The GLAM Workbench also includes a number of examples of how you can <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#map-trove-newspaper-results-by-state\">visualise places of publication</a> of newspaper articles.</p>\n<p>But it’s not just the GLAM Workbench. The <a href=\"https://ardc.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Language_Commons_Australia.pdf\">Linguistics Data Commons of Australia</a>, another activity to be funded as part of the HASS Research Data Commons, will include tools for text analysis and visualisation. The <a href=\"https://www.tlcmap.org/\">Time Layered Cultural Map</a> is developing tools for geospatial visualisation of Australian collections. Surely the focus should be on connecting and reusing what’s available. Again I’m wondering what this project is really adding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"portals-and-platforms\">Portals and platforms</h2>\n<p>The original language describing the funded activity is interesting — it is intended to ‘focus on the delivery of researcher portals accessible through Trove’.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Portals</em> (plural) accessible <em>through</em> (not in) Trove.</strong></p>\n<p>The NLA could meet a fair proportion of its stated objectives right now, simply by including links to QueryPic and the Trove Newspaper and Gazette Harvester. Done! There’s a million dollars saved.</p>\n<p>More seriously, there’s no reason why the outcome of this activity should be a new interface attached to Trove and managed by the NLA. Indeed, such an approach works against integration, reuse, and data sharing. I believe the basic assumptions of the draft plan are seriously flawed. We need to separate out the strands of what’s meant by a ‘platform for advanced research’, and think more creatively and collaboratively about how we could achieve something useful, flexible, and sustainable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wheres-the-api\">Where’s the API?</h2>\n<p>I think the primary role of the NLA in the development of this research platform should be as the data provider. There are numerous ways in which Trove’s data might be improved and enriched in support of new research uses. These improvements could then be pushed through the API to integrate with a range of tools and resources. Which raises the question — where is the API in this plan?</p>\n<p>The only mention of the API comes as an option for a user with ‘high technical expertise’ to extend the analysis provided by the built-in visualisations. This is all backwards. The API is the key pipeline for data-sharing and integration and should be at the heart of this plan.</p>\n<p>This program offers an opportunity to make some much-needed improvements to the API. Here’s a few possibilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bring the web interface and API back into sync so that researchers can easily transfer queries between the two (Trove’s interface update introduced new categories, while the API still groups resources by the original zones).</li>\n<li>Provide public API access to additional data about digitised items. For example, you can get lists of newspaper titles and issues from the API, but there’s no comparable method to get titles and issues for digitised periodicals. The data’s there – it’s used to generate lists of issues in the browse interface – but it’s not in the API. There’s also other resource metadata, such as parent/child relationships, which are embedded in web pages but not exposed in the API.</li>\n<li>Standardise the delivery of OCRd text for different resource types.</li>\n<li>Finally add the People &amp; Organisations data to the main RESTful API.</li>\n<li>Fix the limitations of the web archives CDX API (<a href=\"https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/web-archives/blob/master/comparing_cdx_apis.ipynb\">documented here</a>).</li>\n<li>Add a search API for the web archives.</li>\n<li>And what about a Write API? Integration between components in the HASS RDC would be greatly enhanced if other projects could automatically add structured annotations to existing Trove resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think the HASS RDC would benefit greatly by thinking much more about the role of the Trove API in establishing reusable data flows, and connecting up components.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pathways\">Pathways</h2>\n<p>Anyone who’s been to one of my <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/presentations/\">GLAM Workbench talks</a> will know that I talk a lot about ‘pathways’. My concern is not just to provide useful tools and examples, but to try and connect them in ways that encourage researchers to develop their skills and confidence. So a researcher with limited digital skills can spin up QueryPic and start making visualisations without any specialised knowledge. But if they want to explore the data and assumptions behind QueryPic, they can view a notebook that walks them through the process of getting data from facets and assembling a time series. If they find something interesting in QueryPic, they can go to the Newspaper Harvester and assemble a dataset that helps them zoom into a particular period. There are places to go.</p>\n<p>Similarly, users can start making use of the GLAM Workbench in the cloud using <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/using-binder/\">Binder</a> – one click and it’s running. But as their research develops they might find Binder a bit limiting, so there are options to spin up the GLAM Workbench using <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/using-reclaim-cloud/\">Reclaim Cloud</a> or <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/using-docker/\">Docker</a>. As a researcher’s skills, needs, and questions change, so does their use of the GLAM Workbench. At least that’s the plan – I’m very aware that there’s much, much more to do to build and document these pathways.</p>\n<p>The developments described in the draft plan are focused on providing simple tools for non-technical users. That’s fair enough, but you have to give those users somewhere to go, some path beyond, or else it just becomes another dead end. Users can download their data or visualisation, but then what?</p>\n<p>Of course you don’t point a non-coder to API documentation and say ‘there you go’. But coders can use the API to build and share a range of tools that introduce people to the possibilities of data, and scaffold their learning. Why should there be just one interface? It’s not too difficult to imagine a range of introductory visualisation tools aimed at different humanities disciplines. Instead of focusing inward on a single Trove Viz Lite tool, why not look outwards at ways of embedding Trove data within a range of research training contexts?</p>\n<h2 id=\"integration\">Integration</h2>\n<p>A number of the HASS RDC Evaluation Criteria focus on issues of integration, collaboration, and reuse of existing resources. For example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Project plans should display robust proposal planning including the maximisation of the use or re-use of existing research infrastructure, platforms, tools, services, data storage and compute.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Project plans should display integrated infrastructure layers with other HASS RDC activities, in particular by linking together elements such as data storage, tools, authentication, licensing, networks, cloud and high-performance computing, and access to data resources for reuse.</li>\n<li>Project plans must be robust and contribute to the HASS RDC as a coherent whole that capitalises on existing data collections, adheres to the F.A.I.R. principles, develops collaborative tools, utilises shared underlying infrastructure and has appropriate governance planning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There’s little evidence of this sort of thinking in the draft project plan. I’ve mentioned a few obvious opportunities for integration above, but there are many more. Overall, I think the proposed ‘platform for advanced research’ needs to be designed as a series of interconnected components, and not be seen as the product of a single institution.</p>\n<p>We could imagine, for example, a system where the NLA focused on the delivery of research-ready data via the Trove API. A layer of data filtering, cleaning, and packaging tools could be built on top of the API to help users assemble actionable datasets. The packaging processes could use standards such as RO-Crate to prepare datasets for ingest into data repositories. Existing storage services, such as CloudStor, could be used for saving and sharing working datasets. Another layer of visualisation and analysis tools could either process these datasets, or integrate directly with the API. These tools could be spread across different projects including LDaCA, TLCMap, and the GLAM Workbench — using standards such as Jupyter to encourage sharing and reuse of individual components, and running on a variety of cloud-hosted platforms. Instead of just adding another component to Trove, we’d be building a collaborative network of tool builders and data wranglers — developing capacities across the research sector, and spreading the burden of maintenance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sustainability\">Sustainability</h2>\n<p>The draft project plan includes some pretty worrying comments about long-term support for the new platform. Work Package 5 notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The developed product will require support post release which can be guaranteed for a period not exceeding the contracted period for this project</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ARDC will be responsible for providing ongoing financial support for this phase. It has not been included in the proposal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So once the project is over, the NLA will not support the new platform unless the ARDC provides ongoing funding. What researcher would want to ‘publish’ their data on a platform that could disappear at any time? We all know that sustainability is hard, but you would think that the NLA could at least offer to work collaboratively with the research sector to develop a plan for sustainability, instead of just asking for more money. Why would anyone invest so much for so little?</p>\n<h2 id=\"leadership-and-community\">Leadership and community</h2>\n<p>The development of collaborations and communities also figure prominently in the HASS RDC Evaluation Criteria. For example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Project plans should clearly demonstrate that they enable collaboration and build communities across geographically dispersed research groups through facilitated sharing of high-quality data, particularly for computational analysis; the development of new platforms for collaboration and sharing; and, the encouragement of innovative methodologies through the use of analytic tools.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Project plans must include a demonstrated commitment to ongoing community development to ensure the sustainability of the development is vital. The deliverables will act as ongoing national research infrastructure. They must be broadly usable by more than just the project partners and serve as input to a wide range of research.</li>\n<li>Project plans, and project leads in particular, should demonstrate the research leadership that will foster and encourage the uptake and use of the HASS RDC.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once again the draft project plan falls short. There are no project partners listed. Instead the plan refers broadly to all of Trove’s content partners, none of whom have direct involvement in this project.

				"content_text": "Late last year the Federal Government [announced](https://ministers.dese.gov.au/tehan/improving-hass-and-indigenous-research-infrastructure) it was making an $8.9 million investment in HASS and Indigenous research infrastructure. This program is being managed by the ARDC and will lead to the development of a [HASS Research Data Commons](https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/strategic-activities/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/). According to the ARDC, a research data commons:\n\n> brings together people, skills, data, and related resources such as storage, compute, software, and models to enable researchers to conduct world class data-intensive research\n\nSounds awesome! \n\nBased on scoping studies commissioned by the Department of Education, Skills, and Employment (which have not yet been made public), [four activities were selected for initial funding](https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/strategic-activities/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/recommendations-for-co-investment-in-humanities-arts-and-social-sciences-research-data-commons-program/) under this program. Draft project plans for these four activities have now been [released for public comment](https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/strategic-activities/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/project-plans/).\n\nOne of these activities aims to develop a ’Trove researcher platform for advanced research’:\n\n> Augmenting existing National Library of Australia resources, this platform will enable a focus on the delivery of researcher portals accessible through Trove, Australia’s unique public heritage site. The platform will create tools for visualisation, entity recognition, transcription and geocoding across Trove content and other corpora.\n\nYou can [download the draft project plan](https://ardc.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Research_Platform_TROVE.pdf) for the Trove platform. Funding for this activity will be capped at $2,301,185 across 2021-23. In this post I’ll try to pull together some of my own thoughts on this plan.\n\nI suppose I’d better start with a disclaimer – I’m not a neutral observer in this. I started scraping data from Trove newspapers way back in 2010, building the first versions of tools like QueryPic and the Trove Newspaper Harvester. While I was manager of Trove, from 2013 to 2016, I argued for recognition of Trove as a key part of Australia’s humanities research infrastructure, and highlighted possible research uses of Trove data available through the API. Since then I’ve worked to bring a range of digital tools, examples, tutorials, and hacks together for researchers in the [GLAM Workbench](https://glam-workbench.net/) – a [large number of these](https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/08/26/glam-workbench-a.html) work with data from Trove.\n\nI strongly believe that Trove should receive ongoing funding through [NCRIS](https://www.dese.gov.au/ncris) as a piece of national research infrastructure. Unfortunately though, the draft project plan does not make a strong case for investment – it’s vague, unimaginative, and makes little attempt to integrate with existing tools and services. I think it scores poorly against the ARDC’s [evaluation criteria](https://ardc.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Evaluation-Criteria-HASS-RDC-and-Indigenous-Research-Capability-program.pdf), and doesn’t seem to offer good value for money. As someone who has championed the use of Trove data for research across the last decade, I’m very disappointed.\n\n## What’s planned?\nSo what is being proposed? There seems to be three main components:\n\n1. Authenticated ‘project’ spaces for researchers where datasets relating to a particular research topic can be stored\n2. The ability to create custom datasets from a search in Trove\n3. Tools to visualise stored datasets.\n\nThere’s no doubt that these are all useful functions for researchers, but many problems arise when we look at how they’re going to be implemented.\n\n### 1. Authenticated project spaces\nThe draft plan indicates that authentication of users through the [Australian Access Federation](https://aaf.edu.au/) is preferred. Why? Trove already has a system for the creation of user accounts. Using AAF would limit use of the new platform to those attached to universities or research agencies. I don’t understand what the use of AAF adds to the project, except perhaps to provide an example of integration with existing infrastructure services.\n\nThe plan notes that project spaces could be ‘public’ or ‘private’. Presumably a ‘public’ space would give access to stored datasets, but what sort of access controls would be available in relation to individual datasets? It’s also noted (Deliverable 7) that researchers would have ‘an option to “publish” their research findings for public consumption‘. Does this mean datasets and visualisations would be assigned a DOI (or other persistent identifier) and preserved indefinitely? How might these spaces integrate with existing data repositories?\n\n### 2. Create custom datasets\nThe lack of detail in the plan makes it difficult to assess what’s being proposed here. But it seems that users would be able to construct a search using the Trove web interface (or a new search interface?) and save the results as a dataset. \n\nWhat data would be searched? It’s not clear, but in reference to the visualisations it’s stated that data would come from ’Trove’s existing full text collections (newspapers and gazettes, magazines and newsletters, books)’. So no web archives, and no metadata from any of Trove’s aggregated collections (even without full text, collection metadata can create interesting research possibilities, see for example the [Radio National records](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-music/) in the GLAM Workbench).\n\nWhat will be included in each dataset? There’s few details, but at a minimum you’d expect something like a CSV containing the metadata of all the matching records, and files containing the full text content of the items. These could potentially be *very* large. There’s no indication about how storage and processing demands would be managed, but presumably there would be some per user, or per project, limits.\n\nDeliverable 8, ‘Data and visual download’, states that: \n\n> All query results must be available as downloadable files, this would include CSV, JSON and XML for the query results list.\n\nBut there’s no mention of the full text content at all. Will it be included in downloadable datasets?\n\nAs well as the record metadata and full text, you’d want there to be some metadata captured about the dataset itself – the search query used, when it was captured, the number of records, etc. To support integration and reuse, it would be good to align this with something like [RO Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/).\n\nHow will searches be constructed? It’s not clear if this will be integrated with the existing search interface, or be something completely separate; however, the plan does note that ‘limitations are put onto the dataset like keyword search terms and filters corresponding to the filters currently available in the interface’. So it seems that the new platform will be using the existing search indexes. It’s obviously important for the relationship between existing search functions and the new dataset creation tool to be explicit and transparent so that researchers understand what they’re getting. \n\nIt’s also worth noting that changes to the search interface last year removed some useful options from the advanced search form. In particular, you can no longer exclude matches in tags or comments. If you’re a researcher looking for the occurrence of a particular word, you generally don’t want to include records where that word only appears in a user added tag (I have a story about ‘Word War I’ that illustrates this!).\n\nThis raises a broader issue. There doesn’t seem to be any mention in the project plan of work to improve the metadata and indexing in response to research needs. Even just identifying digitised books in the current web interface can be a bit of a challenge, and digitised books and periodicals can be grouped into work records with other versions. We need to recognise that the needs of discovery sometimes compromise specific research uses.\n\nI’m trying to be constructive in my responses here, but at this point I just have to scream – WHAT ABOUT THE [TROVE NEWSPAPER HARVESTER](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/)? A tool has existed for *ten years* that lets users create a dataset containing metadata and full text from a search in Trove’s newspapers and gazettes. I’ve spent a lot of time over recent years adding features and making it easier to use. Now you can download not only full text, but also PDFs and images of articles. The latest web app version in the GLAM Workbench runs in the cloud. Just one click to start it up, then all you need to do is paste in your Trove API key and the url of your search. It can’t get much easier.\n\nThe GLAM Workbench also includes tools to create datasets and download OCRd text from Trove’s [books](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-books/) and digitised [journals](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/). These are still in notebook form, so are not as easy to use, but I have created pre-harvested datasets of all books and periodicals with OCRd text, and stored them on CloudStor. What’s missing at the moment is something to harvest a collection of journal articles, but this would not be difficult. As an added bonus, the GLAM Workbench has tools to [create full text datasets](https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#harvesting-collections-of-text-from-archived-web-pages) from the Australian Web Archive.\n\nSo what is this project really adding? And why is there no attempt to leverage existing tools and resources?\n\n### 3. Visualise datasets\nAgain, there’s a fair bit of hand waving in the plan, but it seems that users will be able to select a stored dataset and then choose a form of visualisation. The plan says that:\n\n> An initial pilot would allow users to create line graphs that plot the frequency of a search term over time and maps that display results based on state-level geolocation.\n\nUp to three additional visualisations would be created later based on research feedback. It’s not clear which researchers will be consulted and when their feedback will be sought.\n\nThe value of these sorts of visualisations is obviously dependent on the quality and consistency of the metadata. There’s nothing built into this plan that would, for example, allow a researcher to clean or normalise any of the saved data. You have to take what you’re given. The newspaper metadata is generally consistent, but books and periodicals less so. \n\nIt’s also important to clarify what’s meant by ‘the frequency of a search term over time’. Does this mean the number of records matching a search term, or the number of times that the search term actually appears in the full text of all matched records? If the latter, then this *would* be a major enrichment of the available data. Though if this data was available it should be pushed through the API and/or made available as a downloadable dataset for integration with other platforms (perhaps along the lines of the Hathi Trust’s [Extracted Features Dataset](https://analytics.hathitrust.org/datasets)). I suspect, however, that what is actually meant is the number of matching search results.\n\nAgain, the value of any geospatial visualisation depends on what is actually being visualised! The `state` facet in newspapers indicates place of publication, it’s not clear what the `place` facet in other categories represents. For this sort of visualisation to be useful in a research context, there would need to be some explanation of how these values were created, and any gaps or uncertainties.\n\nTime for another scream of frustration — WHAT ABOUT [QUERYPIC](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#querypic)? Another long-standing tool which has already been [cited a number of times](https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/08/30/some-research-projects.html) in research literature. [QueryPic](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#querypic) visualises searches in Trove’s newspapers and gazettes over time. You can adjust time scales and intervals, and download the results as images, a CSV file, and an HTML page. The project plan makes a point of claiming that its tools would not require any coding, but neither does QueryPic. Just plug in an API key and a search URL. I even made [some videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAclcciEeCD2z2BWQ2r3xD_Q8c05HppfP) about it! The GLAM Workbench also includes a number of examples of how you can [visualise places of publication](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#map-trove-newspaper-results-by-state) of newspaper articles.\n\nBut it’s not just the GLAM Workbench. The [Linguistics Data Commons of Australia](https://ardc.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Language_Commons_Australia.pdf), another activity to be funded as part of the HASS Research Data Commons, will include tools for text analysis and visualisation. The [Time Layered Cultural Map](https://www.tlcmap.org/) is developing tools for geospatial visualisation of Australian collections. Surely the focus should be on connecting and reusing what’s available. Again I’m wondering what this project is really adding.\n\n## Portals and platforms\nThe original language describing the funded activity is interesting — it is intended to ‘focus on the delivery of researcher portals accessible through Trove’. \n\n**_Portals_ (plural) accessible *through* (not in) Trove.**\n\nThe NLA could meet a fair proportion of its stated objectives right now, simply by including links to QueryPic and the Trove Newspaper and Gazette Harvester. Done! There’s a million dollars saved.\n\nMore seriously, there’s no reason why the outcome of this activity should be a new interface attached to Trove and managed by the NLA. Indeed, such an approach works against integration, reuse, and data sharing. I believe the basic assumptions of the draft plan are seriously flawed. We need to separate out the strands of what’s meant by a ‘platform for advanced research’, and think more creatively and collaboratively about how we could achieve something useful, flexible, and sustainable. \n\n## Where’s the API?\nI think the primary role of the NLA in the development of this research platform should be as the data provider. There are numerous ways in which Trove’s data might be improved and enriched in support of new research uses. These improvements could then be pushed through the API to integrate with a range of tools and resources. Which raises the question — where is the API in this plan? \n\nThe only mention of the API comes as an option for a user with ‘high technical expertise’ to extend the analysis provided by the built-in visualisations. This is all backwards. The API is the key pipeline for data-sharing and integration and should be at the heart of this plan.\n\nThis program offers an opportunity to make some much-needed improvements to the API. Here’s a few possibilities:\n\n* Bring the web interface and API back into sync so that researchers can easily transfer queries between the two (Trove’s interface update introduced new categories, while the API still groups resources by the original zones).\n* Provide public API access to additional data about digitised items. For example, you can get lists of newspaper titles and issues from the API, but there’s no comparable method to get titles and issues for digitised periodicals. The data’s there – it’s used to generate lists of issues in the browse interface – but it’s not in the API. There’s also other resource metadata, such as parent/child relationships, which are embedded in web pages but not exposed in the API.\n* Standardise the delivery of OCRd text for different resource types. \n* Finally add the People & Organisations data to the main RESTful API.\n* Fix the limitations of the web archives CDX API ([documented here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/web-archives/blob/master/comparing_cdx_apis.ipynb)).\n* Add a search API for the web archives.\n* And what about a Write API? Integration between components in the HASS RDC would be greatly enhanced if other projects could automatically add structured annotations to existing Trove resources.\n\nI think the HASS RDC would benefit greatly by thinking much more about the role of the Trove API in establishing reusable data flows, and connecting up components.\n\n##  Pathways\nAnyone who’s been to one of my [GLAM Workbench talks](https://glam-workbench.net/presentations/) will know that I talk a lot about ‘pathways’. My concern is not just to provide useful tools and examples, but to try and connect them in ways that encourage researchers to develop their skills and confidence. So a researcher with limited digital skills can spin up QueryPic and start making visualisations without any specialised knowledge. But if they want to explore the data and assumptions behind QueryPic, they can view a notebook that walks them through the process of getting data from facets and assembling a time series. If they find something interesting in QueryPic, they can go to the Newspaper Harvester and assemble a dataset that helps them zoom into a particular period. There are places to go.\n\nSimilarly, users can start making use of the GLAM Workbench in the cloud using [Binder](https://glam-workbench.net/using-binder/) – one click and it’s running. But as their research develops they might find Binder a bit limiting, so there are options to spin up the GLAM Workbench using [Reclaim Cloud](https://glam-workbench.net/using-reclaim-cloud/) or [Docker](https://glam-workbench.net/using-docker/). As a researcher’s skills, needs, and questions change, so does their use of the GLAM Workbench. At least that’s the plan – I’m very aware that there’s much, much more to do to build and document these pathways.\n\nThe developments described in the draft plan are focused on providing simple tools for non-technical users. That’s fair enough, but you have to give those users somewhere to go, some path beyond, or else it just becomes another dead end. Users can download their data or visualisation, but then what? \n\nOf course you don’t point a non-coder to API documentation and say ‘there you go’. But coders can use the API to build and share a range of tools that introduce people to the possibilities of data, and scaffold their learning. Why should there be just one interface? It’s not too difficult to imagine a range of introductory visualisation tools aimed at different humanities disciplines. Instead of focusing inward on a single Trove Viz Lite tool, why not look outwards at ways of embedding Trove data within a range of research training contexts?\n\n## Integration\nA number of the HASS RDC Evaluation Criteria focus on issues of integration, collaboration, and reuse of existing resources. For example:\n\n> * Project plans should display robust proposal planning including the maximisation of the use or re-use of existing research infrastructure, platforms, tools, services, data storage and compute.\n* Project plans should display integrated infrastructure layers with other HASS RDC activities, in particular by linking together elements such as data storage, tools, authentication, licensing, networks, cloud and high-performance computing, and access to data resources for reuse.\n* Project plans must be robust and contribute to the HASS RDC as a coherent whole that capitalises on existing data collections, adheres to the F.A.I.R. principles, develops collaborative tools, utilises shared underlying infrastructure and has appropriate governance planning.\n\n\nThere’s little evidence of this sort of thinking in the draft project plan. I’ve mentioned a few obvious opportunities for integration above, but there are many more. Overall, I think the proposed ‘platform for advanced research’ needs to be designed as a series of interconnected components, and not be seen as the product of a single institution.\n\nWe could imagine, for example, a system where the NLA focused on the delivery of research-ready data via the Trove API. A layer of data filtering, cleaning, and packaging tools could be built on top of the API to help users assemble actionable datasets. The packaging processes could use standards such as RO-Crate to prepare datasets for ingest into data repositories. Existing storage services, such as CloudStor, could be used for saving and sharing working datasets. Another layer of visualisation and analysis tools could either process these datasets, or integrate directly with the API. These tools could be spread across different projects including LDaCA, TLCMap, and the GLAM Workbench — using standards such as Jupyter to encourage sharing and reuse of individual components, and running on a variety of cloud-hosted platforms. Instead of just adding another component to Trove, we’d be building a collaborative network of tool builders and data wranglers — developing capacities across the research sector, and spreading the burden of maintenance.\n\n## Sustainability\nThe draft project plan includes some pretty worrying comments about long-term support for the new platform. Work Package 5 notes:\n\n> The developed product will require support post release which can be guaranteed for a period not exceeding the contracted period for this project\n\nAnd:\n\n> ARDC will be responsible for providing ongoing financial support for this phase. It has not been included in the proposal.\n\nSo once the project is over, the NLA will not support the new platform unless the ARDC provides ongoing funding. What researcher would want to ‘publish’ their data on a platform that could disappear at any time? We all know that sustainability is hard, but you would think that the NLA could at least offer to work collaboratively with the research sector to develop a plan for sustainability, instead of just asking for more money. Why would anyone invest so much for so little?\n\n## Leadership and community\nThe development of collaborations and communities also figure prominently in the HASS RDC Evaluation Criteria. For example:\n\n> * Project plans should clearly demonstrate that they enable collaboration and build communities across geographically dispersed research groups through facilitated sharing of high-quality data, particularly for computational analysis; the development of new platforms for collaboration and sharing; and, the encouragement of innovative methodologies through the use of analytic tools.\n* Project plans must include a demonstrated commitment to ongoing community development to ensure the sustainability of the development is vital. The deliverables will act as ongoing national research infrastructure. They must be broadly usable by more than just the project partners and serve as input to a wide range of research.\n* Project plans, and project leads in particular, should demonstrate the research leadership that will foster and encourage the uptake and use of the HASS RDC.\n\n\nOnce again the draft project plan falls short. There are no project partners listed. Instead the plan refers broadly to all of Trove’s content partners, none of whom have direct involvement in this project. Indeed, as noted above, data aggregated from project parters is excluded from the new platform.\n\nThere are no new governance arrangements proposed for this project. Instead the plan refers to the Trove Strategic Advisory Committee which includes representatives from partner organisations. But there are no researcher representatives on this committee.\n\nThe only consultation with the research sector undertaken in the ‘Consultation Phase’ of the project is that undertaken by the ARDC itself. Does that mean this current process whereby the ARDC is soliciting feedback on the project plans? Whoa, meta…\n\nThe plan notes that during the testing phase described in Work Package 3, ‘HASS community members would gain access to a beta version of the product for comment’. However, later it is stated that access would be provided to ’a subset of researchers’, and that only system bugs and ‘high priority improvements’ would be acted upon. \n\nGenerally speaking, it seems that the NLA is seeking as little consultation as possible. It’s not exploring options for collaboration. It’s not engaging with the research community about these developments. That doesn’t seem like an effective way to build communities. Nor does it demonstrate leadership.\n\n## Summing up\nThis project plan can’t be accepted in its current form. We’ve had failures and disappointments in the development of HASS research infrastructure in the past. The HASS RDC program gives us a chance to start afresh, and the focus on integration, data-sharing, and reuse give hope that we can build something that will continue to grow and develop, and not wither through lack of engagement and support. So should the NLA be getting $2 million to add a new component to Trove that is not integrated with other HASS RDC projects, and substantially duplicates tools available elsewhere? No, I don’t think so. They need to go back to the drawing board, undertake some real consultation, and build collaborations, not products.\n\n\n",

				"title": "GLAM Workbench – a platform for digital HASS research",
				"content_html": "<p>We’re in the midst of planning for the <a href=\"https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/strategic-activities/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/\">HASS Research Data Commons</a>, which will deliver some much-needed investment in digital research infrastructure for the humanities and social sciences. Amongst the funded programs are tools for text analysis as part of the Linguistics Data Commons, and a platform for more advanced research using Trove. I’m hoping that this will be an opportunity to take stock of existing tools and resources, and build flexible pathways for researchers that enable them to collect, move, analyse, preserve, and share data across different platforms and services.</p>\n<p>To this end, I thought it might be useful to try and summarise what the <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/\">GLAM Workbench</a> offers, particularly for <a href=\"https://trove.nla.gov.au/\">Trove</a> researchers. The GLAM Workbench doesn’t really have an institutional home, and is mostly unfunded – it’s my passion project. That means that it’s easy to overlook, particularly when the big grants are being doled out. But I think it has a lot to offer and I’m looking forward to exploring ways it can connect with these new initiatives.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-and-moving-data\">Getting and moving data</h2>\n<p>There’s lots of fabulous data in Trove and other GLAM collections. In fact, there’s so much data that it can be difficult for researchers to find and collect what’s relevant to their interests. There are many tools in the GLAM Workbench to help researchers assemble their own datasets. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/\">Get newspaper articles in bulk with the Trove Newspaper and Gazette Harvester</a></strong> – This has been around in some form for more than ten years (it pre-dates the Trove API!). Give it the url of a search in Trove’s newspapers and gazettes and the harvester will save all the metadata in a CSV file, and optionally download the complete articles as OCRd text, images, or PDFs. The amount of data you harvest is really only limited by your patience and disk space. I’ve harvested more than a million articles in the past. The GLAM Workbench includes a web app version of the harvester that runs live in the cloud – just paste in your Trove API key and the search url, and click the button.</li>\n<li><strong>Get Trove newspaper pages as images</strong> – If you need a nice, high-resolution version of a newspaper page you can <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#download-a-page-image\">use this web app</a>. If you want to harvest every front page (or some other particular page) here’s an example that <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#harvest-australian-womens-weekly-covers-or-the-front-pages-of-any-newspaper\">gets all the covers of the <em>Australian Women’s Weekly</em></a>. A pre-harvested <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#australian-womens-weekly-front-covers-1933-to-1982\">collection of the AWW covers</a> is included as a bonus extra.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#save-a-trove-newspaper-article-as-an-image\">Get Trove newspaper articles as images</a></strong> – The Trove web interface makes it difficult to download complete images of articles, but this tool will do the job. There’s a handy web app to grab individual images, but the code from this tool is reused in other places such as the Trove Newspaper Harvester and the Omeka uploader, and could be built-in to your own research workflows.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#upload-trove-newspaper-articles-to-omeka-s\">Upload Trove newspaper articles to Omeka</a></strong> – Whether you’re creating on online exhibition or building a research database, Omeka can be very useful. This notebook connects Trove’s newspapers to Omeka for easy upload. Your selected articles can come from a search query, a Trove list, a Zotero library, or just a list of article ids. Metadata records are created in Omeka for each article and newspaper, and an image of each article is attached.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#get-ocrd-text-from-a-digitised-journal-in-trove\">Get OCRd text from digitised periodicals in Trove</a></strong> – They’re often overshadowed by the newspapers, but there’s now lots of digitised journals, magazines, and parliamentary papers in Trove. You can get article-level data from the API, but not issue data. This notebook enables researchers to get metadata and OCRd text from every available issue of a periodical. To make researchers’ lives even easier, I regularly harvest <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#ocrd-text-from-trove-digitised-journals\"><strong>all</strong> the available OCRd text</a> from digitised periodicals in Trove. The latest harvest downloaded 51,928 issues from 1,163 periodicals – that’s about 10gb of text. You can <a href=\"https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/trove-journals/blob/master/digital-journals-with-text.md\">browse the list of periodicals</a> with OCRd text, or <a href=\"https://trove-digital-periodicals.glitch.me/data/trove-digital-journals\">search this database</a>. All the OCRd text is stored in a public repository on CloudStor.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#get-covers-or-any-other-pages-from-a-digitised-journal-in-trove\">Get page images from digitised periodicals in Trove</a></strong> – There’s more than text in digitised periodicals, and you might want to download images of pages for visual analysis. This notebook shows you how to get cover images, but could be easily modified to get another page, or a PDF. I used a modified version of this to create <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#editorial-cartoons-from-the-bulletin-1886-to-1952\">a collection of 3,471 full page editorial cartoons</a> from <em>The Bulletin</em>, 1886 to 1952 – all available to download from CloudStor.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-books/#harvesting-the-text-of-digitised-books-and-ephemera\">Get OCRd text from digitised books in Trove</a></strong> – Yep, there’s digitised books as well as newspapers and periodicals. You can download OCRd text from an individual book using the Trove web interface, but how do you make a collection of books without all that pointing and clicking? This notebook downloads all the available OCRd text from digitised books in Trove. The latest harvest includes <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-books/#ocrd-text-from-trove-books-and-ephemera\">text from 26,762 works</a>. You can explore the results <a href=\"https://trove-digital-books.glitch.me/data/trove-digital-books\">using this database</a>.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#harvest-parliament-press-releases-from-trove\">Harvest parliamentary press releases from Trove</a></strong> – Trove includes more than 380,000 press releases, speeches, and interview transcripts issued by Australian federal politicians and saved by the Parliamentary Library. This notebook shows you how to harvest both metadata and fulltext from a search of the parliamentary press releases. For example, here’s a collection of <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#politicians-talking-about-immigrants-and-refugees\">politicians talking about ‘refugees’</a>, and another <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#politicians-talking-about-covid\">relating to COVID-19</a>.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-music/#harvest-abc-radio-national-records-from-trove\">Harvest details of Radio National programs from Trove</a></strong> – Trove creates records for programs broadcast on ABC Radio National, for the major current affairs programs these records at at segment level. Even though they don’t provide full transcripts, this data provide a rich, fine-grained record of Australia’s recent political, social, and economic history. This notebook shows you how to download the Radio National data. If you just want to dive straight in, there’s also a <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-music/#abc-radio-national-programs\">pre-harvested collection</a> containing more than 400,000 records, with separate downloads for some of the main programs.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#find-all-the-archived-versions-of-a-web-page\">Find all the versions of an archived web page in Trove</a></strong> – Many of the tools in the <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/\">Web Archives section</a> of the GLAM Workbench will work with the Australian Web Archive, which is part of Trove. This notebook shows you how to get data about the number of times a web page has been archived over time.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#harvesting-collections-of-text-from-archived-web-pages\">Harvesting collections of text from archived web pages in Trove</a></strong> – If you want to explore how the content of a web page changes over time, you can use this notebook to capture the text content of every archived version of a web page.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#convert-a-trove-list-into-a-csv-file\">Convert a Trove list into a CSV file</a></strong> – While Trove provides a data download option for lists, it leaves out a lot of useful data. This notebook downloads full details of newspaper articles and other works in a list and saves them as CSV files. Like the Trove Newspaper Harvester, it lets you download OCRd text and images from newspaper articles.</li>\n<li><strong>Collecting information about Trove user activity</strong> – It’s not just the content of Trove that provides interesting research data, it’s also the way people engage with it. Using the Trove API it’s possible to harvest details of <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/\">all user created lists and tags</a>. And yes, there’s pre-harvested collections of <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#trove-lists-metadata\">lists</a> and <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#trove-public-tags\">tags</a> for the impatient.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While I’m focusing here on Trove, there’s also tools to create datasets from the <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/recordsearch/\">National Archives of Australia</a>, <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/digitalnz/\">Digital NZ and Papers Past</a>, the <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/nma/\">National Museum of Australia</a> and more. And there’s a <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/glam-data-list/\">big list of readily downloadable datasets</a> from Australian GLAM organisations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"visualisation-and-analysis\">Visualisation and analysis</h2>\n<p>Many of the notebooks listed above include examples that demonstrate ways of exploring and analysing your harvested data. There are also a number of companion notebooks that examine some possibilities in more detail, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/#exploring-your-troveharvester-data\">Explore your Trove newspaper harvests</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/#display-the-results-of-a-harvest-as-a-searchable-database-using-datasette\">Load your Trove newspaper harvest in Datasette</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-music/#exploring-abc-radio-national-metadata\">Exploring ABC Radio National metadata</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#analyse-public-tags-added-to-trove\">Analyse public tags added to Trove</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>But there are also many other notebooks that demonstrate methods for analysing Trove’s content, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#querypic\">QueryPic</a></strong> – Another tool that’s been around in different forms for a decade, QueryPic visualises searches in Trove’s newspapers. The latest web app couldn’t be simpler, just paste in your API key and a search url and create charts showing the number of matching articles over time. You can combine queries, change time scales, and download the data and visualisations.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#visualise-trove-newspaper-searches-over-time\">Visualise Trove newspaper searches over time</a></strong> – This is like a deconstructed version of QueryPic that walks you through the process of using Trove’s facets to assemble a dataset of results over time. It provide a lot of detail on the sorts of data available, and the questions we can ask of it.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#visualise-the-total-number-of-newspaper-articles-in-trove-by-year-and-state\">Visualise the total number of newspaper articles in Trove by year and state</a></strong> – This notebook uses a modified version of the code above to analyse the construction and context of Trove’s newspaper corpus itself. What are you actually searching? Meet the WWI effect and the copyright cliff of death! This is a great place to start if you want to get people thinking critically about digital resources are constructed.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#analyse-rates-of-ocr-correction\">Analyse rates of OCR correction</a></strong> – Some more meta-analysis of the Trove corpus itself, this time focusing on patterns of OCR correction by Trove users.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#finding-non-english-newspapers-in-trove\">Identifying non-English language newspapers in Trove</a></strong> – There are a growing number of non-English language newspapers digitised in Trove. However, if you&rsquo;re only searching using English keywords, you might never know that they&rsquo;re there. This notebook analyses a sample of articles from every newspaper in Trove to identify non-English content.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#beyond-the-copyright-cliff-of-death\">Beyond the copyright cliff of death</a></strong> – Most of the newspaper articles on Trove were published before 1955, but there are some from the later period. This notebook helps you find out how many, and which newspapers they were published in.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#map-trove-newspaper-results-by-state\">Map Trove newspaper results by state</a></strong> – This notebook uses the Trove <code>state</code> facet to create a choropleth map that visualises the number of search results per state.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#map-trove-newspaper-results-by-place-of-publication\">Map Trove newspaper results by place of publication</a></strong> – This notebook uses the Trove <code>title</code> facet to find the number of results per newspaper, then merges the results with a dataset of geolocated newspapers to map where articles were published.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#compare-two-versions-of-an-archived-web-page\">Compare two versions of an archived web page</a></strong> – This notebook demonstrates a number of different ways of comparing versions of archived web pages. Just choose a repository, enter a url, and select two dates to see comparisons based on: page metadata, basic statistics such as file size and number of words, numbers of internal and external links, cosine similarity of text, line by line differences in text or code, and screenshots.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#display-changes-in-the-text-of-an-archived-web-page-over-time\">Display changes in the text of an archived web page over time</a></strong> – This web app gathers all the available versions of a web page and then visualises changes in its content between versions – what’s been added, removed, and changed?</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#using-screenshots-to-visualise-change-in-a-page-over-time\">Use screenshots to visualise change in a page over time</a></strong>– Create a series of full page screenshots of a web page over time, then assemble them into a time series.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are also possibilities for using Trove data creatively.

				"content_text": "We’re in the midst of planning for the [HASS Research Data Commons](https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/strategic-activities/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/), which will deliver some much-needed investment in digital research infrastructure for the humanities and social sciences. Amongst the funded programs are tools for text analysis as part of the Linguistics Data Commons, and a platform for more advanced research using Trove. I’m hoping that this will be an opportunity to take stock of existing tools and resources, and build flexible pathways for researchers that enable them to collect, move, analyse, preserve, and share data across different platforms and services. \n\nTo this end, I thought it might be useful to try and summarise what the [GLAM Workbench](https://glam-workbench.net/) offers, particularly for [Trove](https://trove.nla.gov.au/) researchers. The GLAM Workbench doesn’t really have an institutional home, and is mostly unfunded – it’s my passion project. That means that it’s easy to overlook, particularly when the big grants are being doled out. But I think it has a lot to offer and I’m looking forward to exploring ways it can connect with these new initiatives.\n\n## Getting and moving data\nThere’s lots of fabulous data in Trove and other GLAM collections. In fact, there’s so much data that it can be difficult for researchers to find and collect what’s relevant to their interests. There are many tools in the GLAM Workbench to help researchers assemble their own datasets. For example:\n\n* **[Get newspaper articles in bulk with the Trove Newspaper and Gazette Harvester](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/)** – This has been around in some form for more than ten years (it pre-dates the Trove API!). Give it the url of a search in Trove’s newspapers and gazettes and the harvester will save all the metadata in a CSV file, and optionally download the complete articles as OCRd text, images, or PDFs. The amount of data you harvest is really only limited by your patience and disk space. I’ve harvested more than a million articles in the past. The GLAM Workbench includes a web app version of the harvester that runs live in the cloud – just paste in your Trove API key and the search url, and click the button. \n*  **Get Trove newspaper pages as images** – If you need a nice, high-resolution version of a newspaper page you can [use this web app](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#download-a-page-image). If you want to harvest every front page (or some other particular page) here’s an example that [gets all the covers of the *Australian Women’s Weekly*](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#harvest-australian-womens-weekly-covers-or-the-front-pages-of-any-newspaper). A pre-harvested [collection of the AWW covers](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#australian-womens-weekly-front-covers-1933-to-1982) is included as a bonus extra.\n*  **[Get Trove newspaper articles as images](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#save-a-trove-newspaper-article-as-an-image)** – The Trove web interface makes it difficult to download complete images of articles, but this tool will do the job. There’s a handy web app to grab individual images, but the code from this tool is reused in other places such as the Trove Newspaper Harvester and the Omeka uploader, and could be built-in to your own research workflows.\n* **[Upload Trove newspaper articles to Omeka](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#upload-trove-newspaper-articles-to-omeka-s)** – Whether you’re creating on online exhibition or building a research database, Omeka can be very useful. This notebook connects Trove’s newspapers to Omeka for easy upload. Your selected articles can come from a search query, a Trove list, a Zotero library, or just a list of article ids. Metadata records are created in Omeka for each article and newspaper, and an image of each article is attached.\n* **[Get OCRd text from digitised periodicals in Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#get-ocrd-text-from-a-digitised-journal-in-trove)** – They’re often overshadowed by the newspapers, but there’s now lots of digitised journals, magazines, and parliamentary papers in Trove. You can get article-level data from the API, but not issue data. This notebook enables researchers to get metadata and OCRd text from every available issue of a periodical. To make researchers’ lives even easier, I regularly harvest [**all** the available OCRd text](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#ocrd-text-from-trove-digitised-journals) from digitised periodicals in Trove. The latest harvest downloaded 51,928 issues from 1,163 periodicals – that’s about 10gb of text. You can [browse the list of periodicals](https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/trove-journals/blob/master/digital-journals-with-text.md) with OCRd text, or [search this database](https://trove-digital-periodicals.glitch.me/data/trove-digital-journals). All the OCRd text is stored in a public repository on CloudStor.\n* **[Get page images from digitised periodicals in Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#get-covers-or-any-other-pages-from-a-digitised-journal-in-trove)** – There’s more than text in digitised periodicals, and you might want to download images of pages for visual analysis. This notebook shows you how to get cover images, but could be easily modified to get another page, or a PDF. I used a modified version of this to create [a collection of 3,471 full page editorial cartoons](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#editorial-cartoons-from-the-bulletin-1886-to-1952) from _The Bulletin_, 1886 to 1952 – all available to download from CloudStor.\n* **[Get OCRd text from digitised books in Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-books/#harvesting-the-text-of-digitised-books-and-ephemera)** – Yep, there’s digitised books as well as newspapers and periodicals. You can download OCRd text from an individual book using the Trove web interface, but how do you make a collection of books without all that pointing and clicking? This notebook downloads all the available OCRd text from digitised books in Trove. The latest harvest includes [text from 26,762 works](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-books/#ocrd-text-from-trove-books-and-ephemera). You can explore the results [using this database](https://trove-digital-books.glitch.me/data/trove-digital-books).\n* **[Harvest parliamentary press releases from Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#harvest-parliament-press-releases-from-trove)** – Trove includes more than 380,000 press releases, speeches, and interview transcripts issued by Australian federal politicians and saved by the Parliamentary Library. This notebook shows you how to harvest both metadata and fulltext from a search of the parliamentary press releases. For example, here’s a collection of [politicians talking about ‘refugees’](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#politicians-talking-about-immigrants-and-refugees), and another [relating to COVID-19](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#politicians-talking-about-covid).\n* **[Harvest details of Radio National programs from Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-music/#harvest-abc-radio-national-records-from-trove)** – Trove creates records for programs broadcast on ABC Radio National, for the major current affairs programs these records at at segment level. Even though they don’t provide full transcripts, this data provide a rich, fine-grained record of Australia’s recent political, social, and economic history. This notebook shows you how to download the Radio National data. If you just want to dive straight in, there’s also a [pre-harvested collection](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-music/#abc-radio-national-programs) containing more than 400,000 records, with separate downloads for some of the main programs.\n* **[Find all the versions of an archived web page in Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#find-all-the-archived-versions-of-a-web-page)** – Many of the tools in the [Web Archives section](https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/) of the GLAM Workbench will work with the Australian Web Archive, which is part of Trove. This notebook shows you how to get data about the number of times a web page has been archived over time.\n* **[Harvesting collections of text from archived web pages in Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#harvesting-collections-of-text-from-archived-web-pages)** – If you want to explore how the content of a web page changes over time, you can use this notebook to capture the text content of every archived version of a web page.\n*  **[Convert a Trove list into a CSV file](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#convert-a-trove-list-into-a-csv-file)** – While Trove provides a data download option for lists, it leaves out a lot of useful data. This notebook downloads full details of newspaper articles and other works in a list and saves them as CSV files. Like the Trove Newspaper Harvester, it lets you download OCRd text and images from newspaper articles.\n* **Collecting information about Trove user activity** – It’s not just the content of Trove that provides interesting research data, it’s also the way people engage with it. Using the Trove API it’s possible to harvest details of [all user created lists and tags](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/). And yes, there’s pre-harvested collections of [lists](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#trove-lists-metadata) and [tags](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#trove-public-tags) for the impatient.\n\nWhile I’m focusing here on Trove, there’s also tools to create datasets from the [National Archives of Australia](https://glam-workbench.net/recordsearch/), [Digital NZ and Papers Past](https://glam-workbench.net/digitalnz/), the [National Museum of Australia](https://glam-workbench.net/nma/) and more. And there’s a [big list of readily downloadable datasets](https://glam-workbench.net/glam-data-list/) from Australian GLAM organisations.\n\n## Visualisation and analysis\nMany of the notebooks listed above include examples that demonstrate ways of exploring and analysing your harvested data. There are also a number of companion notebooks that examine some possibilities in more detail, for example:\n\n* [Explore your Trove newspaper harvests](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/#exploring-your-troveharvester-data)\n* [Load your Trove newspaper harvest in Datasette](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/#display-the-results-of-a-harvest-as-a-searchable-database-using-datasette)\n* [Exploring ABC Radio National metadata](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-music/#exploring-abc-radio-national-metadata)\n* [Analyse public tags added to Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#analyse-public-tags-added-to-trove)\n\nBut there are also many other notebooks that demonstrate methods for analysing Trove’s content, for example:\n\n* **[QueryPic](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#querypic)** – Another tool that’s been around in different forms for a decade, QueryPic visualises searches in Trove’s newspapers. The latest web app couldn’t be simpler, just paste in your API key and a search url and create charts showing the number of matching articles over time. You can combine queries, change time scales, and download the data and visualisations.\n* **[Visualise Trove newspaper searches over time](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#visualise-trove-newspaper-searches-over-time)** – This is like a deconstructed version of QueryPic that walks you through the process of using Trove’s facets to assemble a dataset of results over time. It provide a lot of detail on the sorts of data available, and the questions we can ask of it.\n*  **[Visualise the total number of newspaper articles in Trove by year and state](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#visualise-the-total-number-of-newspaper-articles-in-trove-by-year-and-state)** – This notebook uses a modified version of the code above to analyse the construction and context of Trove’s newspaper corpus itself. What are you actually searching? Meet the WWI effect and the copyright cliff of death! This is a great place to start if you want to get people thinking critically about digital resources are constructed.\n*  **[Analyse rates of OCR correction](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#analyse-rates-of-ocr-correction)** – Some more meta-analysis of the Trove corpus itself, this time focusing on patterns of OCR correction by Trove users.\n*  **[Identifying non-English language newspapers in Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#finding-non-english-newspapers-in-trove)** – There are a growing number of non-English language newspapers digitised in Trove. However, if you're only searching using English keywords, you might never know that they're there. This notebook analyses a sample of articles from every newspaper in Trove to identify non-English content.\n*  **[Beyond the copyright cliff of death](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#beyond-the-copyright-cliff-of-death)** – Most of the newspaper articles on Trove were published before 1955, but there are some from the later period. This notebook helps you find out how many, and which newspapers they were published in.\n*  **[Map Trove newspaper results by state](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#map-trove-newspaper-results-by-state)** – This notebook uses the Trove `state` facet to create a choropleth map that visualises the number of search results per state. \n*  **[Map Trove newspaper results by place of publication](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#map-trove-newspaper-results-by-place-of-publication)** – This notebook uses the Trove `title` facet to find the number of results per newspaper, then merges the results with a dataset of geolocated newspapers to map where articles were published.\n*  **[Compare two versions of an archived web page](https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#compare-two-versions-of-an-archived-web-page)** – This notebook demonstrates a number of different ways of comparing versions of archived web pages. Just choose a repository, enter a url, and select two dates to see comparisons based on: page metadata, basic statistics such as file size and number of words, numbers of internal and external links, cosine similarity of text, line by line differences in text or code, and screenshots.\n*  **[Display changes in the text of an archived web page over time](https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#display-changes-in-the-text-of-an-archived-web-page-over-time)** – This web app gathers all the available versions of a web page and then visualises changes in its content between versions – what’s been added, removed, and changed?\n* **[Use screenshots to visualise change in a page over time](https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#using-screenshots-to-visualise-change-in-a-page-over-time)**– Create a series of full page screenshots of a web page over time, then assemble them into a time series.\n\nThere are also possibilities for using Trove data creatively. For example you can [create 'scissors and paste' messages from Trove newspaper articles](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#create-scissors-and-paste-messages-from-trove-newspaper-articles).\n\n## Documentation and examples\nAll the Trove notebooks in the GLAM Workbench help document the possibilities and limits of the Trove API. The examples above can be modified and reworked to suit different research interests. Some notebooks also explore particular aspects of the API, for example:\n\n* **[Trove API Introduction](https://glam-workbench.net/trove/)** – Some very basic examples of making requests and understanding results.\n*  **[Today’s news yesterday](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#todays-news-yesterday)** – Uses the `date` index and the `firstpageseq` parameter to find articles from exactly 100 years ago that were published on the front page. It then selects one of the articles at random and downloads and displays an image of the front page.\n*  **[The use of standard licences and rights statements in Trove image records](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-images/#the-use-of-standard-licences-and-rights-statements-in-trove-image-records)** – Version 2.1 of the Trove API introduced a new rights index that you can use to limit your search results to records that include one of a list of standard licences and rights statements. We can also use this index to build a picture of which rights statements are currently being used, and by who.\n*  **[Random items from Trove](https://glam-workbench.net/trove-random/)** – Changes to the Trove API meant that techniques you could previously use to select resources at random no longer work. This section documents some alternative ways of retrieving random-ish works and newspaper articles from Trove. \n\nAnd while it’s not officially part of the GLAM Workbench, I also maintain the [Trove API Console](https://troveconsole.herokuapp.com/) which provides lots of examples of the API in action.\n\n## Pathways\nIn developing the GLAM Workbench I’m very aware that people will arrive with different levels of digital skill, confidence, and experience. That’s why I’ve been putting a lot of thought and effort into ways of providing a range of entry points.\n\nSomeone who might not identify as a ‘digital’ researcher can, with a single click, start up QueryPic and start exploring changes over time in Trove’s newspapers. This is possible because the GLAM Workbench is configured to [make use of Binder](https://glam-workbench.net/using-binder/), a service that spins up customised computing environments as needed.\n\nAnother researcher might start running the Trove Newspaper Harvester using Binder, but find that they want to run bigger and longer harvests. In that case, the GLAM Workbench offers a one-click installation of the Trove Newspaper Harvester on [Reclaim Cloud](https://glam-workbench.net/using-reclaim-cloud/). Unlike Binder, Reclaim Cloud environments are persistent, so you can run the harvester for as long as you want without the worry of interruptions.\n\nYet another researcher might want to understand how the Trove API works and the sorts of data that it makes available. By exploring the various notebooks they’ll find useful snippets of code they can try out in their own projects.\n\nThe GLAM Workbench connects outwards to make use of a range of other services – the notebooks run in Binder, Reclaim Cloud, and Docker; the code is all openly licensed and publicly available through GitHub and Zenodo; data is hosted on GitHub, CloudStor, and Zenodo; datasets can be explored using Datasette running on Glitch or Google CloudRun. I’m hoping that the new investments in HASS research infrastructure will embed a similar philosophy, connecting up existing services rather than starting from scratch.\n\n## The future\n\nThis is just an outline on what the GLAM Workbench currently offers researchers wanting to make use of the data available from Trove. It's all there now, publicly accessible, openly licensed, and ready to use – take it, use it, change it, share it. But there's **much more** I'd like to do, both in regard to Trove and to encourage use of GLAM data more generally. I'm also interested in your ideas for new tools, examples, or data sources – what would help your research? You can [add a suggestion](https://glam-workbench.net/suggest-a-topic/) in GitHub, or post a comment in the [GLAM Workbench channel](https://ozglam.chat/c/glam-workbench/8) of OzGLAM Help.\n\nSee the [Getting Started section](https://glam-workbench.net/getting-started/) of the GLAM Workbench for more hints and examples.

This embeds the tags within the item record, so you can work through a set of results, extracting all the tags as you go.

Updated notebooks include:\n\n* [Harvest items from a search in RecordSearch](https://glam-workbench.net/recordsearch/#harvest-items-from-a-search-in-recordsearch) – save the results of an item search in RecordSearch as a downloadable dataset, you can also save images and PDFs from digitised files (PDF saving is new!)\n* [Harvest files with the access status of ‘closed’](https://glam-workbench.net/recordsearch/#harvest-files-with-the-access-status-of-closed) – find out what we’re not allowed to see by harvesting details of ‘closed’ files\n\nOther updates include:\n\n* Python packages updated\n* Integration with Reclaim Cloud allowing 1-click installation of the whole repository and environment\n* Automatic creation of Docker images when the repository is updated\n* Updated [README](https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/recordsearch#readme) and repository index with list of all notebooks\n* Notebooks intended to run as apps now use Voila rather than Appmode for better integration with Jupyter Lab\n* `requirements-unpinned.txt` added to repository for people who want to develop the notebooks in their own clean environment \n\nHope you find these changes useful! #dhhacks\n",

				"title": "Introducing the new, improved RecordSearch Data Scraper!",
				"content_html": "<p>It was way back in 2009 that I created <a href=\"http://discontents.com.au/some-archives-hacking/\">my first scraper</a> for getting machine-readable data out of the National Archives of Australia&rsquo;s online database, RecordSearch. Since then I’ve used versions of this scraper in a number of different projects such as <a href=\"https://www.realfaceofwhiteaustralia.net/\">The Real Face of White Australia</a>, <a href=\"https://closedaccess.herokuapp.com/\">Closed Access</a>, and <a href=\"https://owebrowse.herokuapp.com/redactions/\">Redacted</a> (including the <a href=\"https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/04/21/secrets-and-lives.html\">recent update</a>). The scraper is also embedded in many of the notebooks that I’ve created for the <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/recordsearch/\">RecordSearch section</a> of the GLAM Workbench.</p>\n<p>However, the scraper was showing its age. The main problem was that one of its dependencies, Robobrowser, is no longer maintained. This made it difficult to update. I&rsquo;d put off a major rewrite, thinking that RecordSearch itself might be getting a much-needed overhaul, but I could wait no longer. Introducing the brand new <a href=\"https://github.com/wragge/recordsearch_data_scraper\">RecordSearch Data Scraper</a>.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Just like the old version, the new scraper delivers machine-readable data relating to Items, Series and Agencies – both from individual records, and search results. It also adds a little extra to the basic metadata, for example, if an Item is digitised, the data includes the number of pages in the file. Series records can include the number of digitised files, and the breakdown of files by access category.</p>\n<p>The new scraper adds in some additional search parameters for Series and Agencies. It also makes use of a simple caching system to improve speed and efficiency.  RecordSearch makes use of an odd assortment of sessions, redirects, and hidden forms, which make scraping a challenge. Hopefully I’ve nailed down the idiosyncrasies, but I expect to catching bugs for a while.</p>\n<p>I created the new scraper in Jupyter using <a href=\"https://github.com/fastai/nbdev\">NBDev</a>.

				"content_text": "It was way back in 2009 that I created [my first scraper](http://discontents.com.au/some-archives-hacking/) for getting machine-readable data out of the National Archives of Australia's online database, RecordSearch. Since then I’ve used versions of this scraper in a number of different projects such as [The Real Face of White Australia](https://www.realfaceofwhiteaustralia.net/), [Closed Access](https://closedaccess.herokuapp.com/), and [Redacted](https://owebrowse.herokuapp.com/redactions/) (including the [recent update](https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/04/21/secrets-and-lives.html)). The scraper is also embedded in many of the notebooks that I’ve created for the [RecordSearch section](https://glam-workbench.net/recordsearch/) of the GLAM Workbench.\n\nHowever, the scraper was showing its age. The main problem was that one of its dependencies, Robobrowser, is no longer maintained. This made it difficult to update. I'd put off a major rewrite, thinking that RecordSearch itself might be getting a much-needed overhaul, but I could wait no longer. Introducing the brand new [RecordSearch Data Scraper](https://github.com/wragge/recordsearch_data_scraper).\n\n<img src=\"https://updates.timsherratt.org/uploads/2021/ab67b3d0c3.png\" width=\"806\" height=\"422\" alt=\"\" />\n\nJust like the old version, the new scraper delivers machine-readable data relating to Items, Series and Agencies – both from individual records, and search results. It also adds a little extra to the basic metadata, for example, if an Item is digitised, the data includes the number of pages in the file. Series records can include the number of digitised files, and the breakdown of files by access category. \n\nThe new scraper adds in some additional search parameters for Series and Agencies. It also makes use of a simple caching system to improve speed and efficiency.  RecordSearch makes use of an odd assortment of sessions, redirects, and hidden forms, which make scraping a challenge. Hopefully I’ve nailed down the idiosyncrasies, but I expect to catching bugs for a while.\n\nI created the new scraper in Jupyter using [NBDev](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev). NBDev helps you to keep your code, examples, tests, and documentation all together in Jupyter notebooks. When you're ready, it converts the code from the notebooks  into distributable Python libraries, runs all your tests, and builds a [documentation site](https://wragge.github.io/recordsearch_data_scraper/). It’s very cool.\n\nHaving updated the scraper, I now need to update the notebooks in the GLAM Workbench – more on that soon. The maintenance never ends! #dhhacks\n",

I’ve also included a little rotating slideshow built using [Slides.com](https://slides.com).\n\n<iframe src=\"https://slides.com/wragge/gw-highlights/embed?byline=hidden&share=hidden\" width=\"576\" height=\"420\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nOther recent additions include a new [Grants and Awards](https://glam-workbench.github.io/awards/) page. #dhhacks\n\n",

Despite Green OA policies that allow researchers to share versions of their articles through institutional repositories, Australian history journals still seem to be about 94% closed.\n\nFull details are [in this notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/wragge/ozhist-openaccess/blob/9e1f81cd3917a1a01b2cf4ac6cc376a63c9ff0a3/open_access_versions_australian_hass_journals.ipynb).\n\n**But this can be fixed!** If you're in a university, talk to your librarians about depositing a Green OA version of your article in an institutional repository. If not, you can use the [Share your paper](https://shareyourpaper.org/) service to upload a Green OA version to Zenodo. Your research will be easier to find, easier to access, easier to cite, and available to everyone – not just those with the luxury of an institutional subscription. #dhhacks\n\n<img src=\"https://updates.timsherratt.org/uploads/2021/cd60058555.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"311\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"https://updates.timsherratt.org/uploads/2021/4484496c82.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"293\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"https://updates.timsherratt.org/uploads/2021/b873500284.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"501\" alt=\"\" />\n",

And, in many cases, it’s likely that it will be impossible to get the total down below 100.

Some items will never be shared.</p>\n<p>Does this matter? People who follow the bots on Twitter might not notice much difference.

I’m also currently in the midst of preparing our house for sale ahead of a move to Tasmania. Eeeek!</p>\n<p>I’m planning to create updated versions of all the bot templates on Glitch. They’ll be modified to use Version 2 of the Trove API and I’ll also take the chance to update them to Python 3. I’ll try implementing some of the random-ish strategies described above and see how they work. My aim at this stage is really just to try and keep people’s creations alive and tweeting.</p>\n<p>For bot creators/maintainers, the upgrade process should be pretty painless. It should just be a matter of hitting the ‘remix’ button on the updated templates, copying across the configuration details from the current bot, and then adjusting your Cron service to point at the new bot. Of course, if you’ve made any customisations, you’ll have to copy these across to the new code.</p>\n<p>As I noted, Collection and Tag bots might require some additional customisation to make sure as much of the collection as possible is exposed.</p>\n<p>I’ll document the upgrade process and will be available on Twitter to help.

I’ll let you know once I’ve worked out what needs to happen.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-value-of-randomness\">The value of randomness</h2>\n<p>I’ve written elsewhere about the way Twitter bots can <a href=\"https://medium.com/open-glam/life-on-the-outside-collections-contexts-and-the-wild-wild-web-4d334ccddee2\">mobilise collections</a>, letting them loose in places where people congregate rather than waiting for visitors to find your website.

But it opens up opportunities for creativity and engagement that I think are really important. If you agree, you might like to contact the Trove team and let them know — hopefully a bit of randomness might make it into future API upgrades.</p>\n",

Playing with the sort options might open up this window a bit, but I think that the range of results from which the bots draw their ‘randomly’ selected results will, in most cases, be limited. Some items will never be shared.\n\nDoes this matter? People who follow the bots on Twitter might not notice much difference. But the bots’ ability to surface unexpected content will be hampered. They’ll still be sharing records, but they’ll also be hiding some. I think this matters.\n\n## The plan\n\nWith Version 1 of the API being switched off in November, time is short. I’m also currently in the midst of preparing our house for sale ahead of a move to Tasmania. Eeeek! \n\nI’m planning to create updated versions of all the bot templates on Glitch. They’ll be modified to use Version 2 of the Trove API and I’ll also take the chance to update them to Python 3. I’ll try implementing some of the random-ish strategies described above and see how they work. My aim at this stage is really just to try and keep people’s creations alive and tweeting.\n\nFor bot creators/maintainers, the upgrade process should be pretty painless. It should just be a matter of hitting the ‘remix’ button on the updated templates, copying across the configuration details from the current bot, and then adjusting your Cron service to point at the new bot. Of course, if you’ve made any customisations, you’ll have to copy these across to the new code.\n\nAs I noted, Collection and Tag bots might require some additional customisation to make sure as much of the collection as possible is exposed.\n\nI’ll document the upgrade process and will be available on Twitter to help. I’m hoping to get this done in the next couple of weeks. Please bear with me…\n\n## TroveNewsBot and TroveBot\n\nI’ll also have to make some changes to [TroveNewsBot](https://twitter.com/TroveNewsBot) and [TroveBot](https://twitter.com/TroveBot) which have seen sharing Trove resources with the world since 2013. As with the Glitch bots, their ability to share random items and respond to the \\#luckydip hashtag will be limited, however, their ability to respond to other queries shouldn’t be affected.\n\n## Other apps\n\nThere are various other apps that I’ve created over the years that will be affected by this change — most notably the game [Headline Roulette](http://headlineroulette.net/). People who have forked or remixed versions of Headline Roulette will also need to make some changes. I’ll let you know once I’ve worked out what needs to happen.\n\n## The value of randomness\n\nI’ve written elsewhere about the way Twitter bots can [mobilise collections](https://medium.com/open-glam/life-on-the-outside-collections-contexts-and-the-wild-wild-web-4d334ccddee2), letting them loose in places where people congregate rather than waiting for visitors to find your website. I’ve also talked about the [value of play](http://timsherratt.org/blog/muliplication-of-contexts/) in coming to grips with large cultural collections. \n\n> Collection bots are versions of ourselves, unable to contain our excitement at our latest discoveries. Look at what I found! They point to the play, to the fun, of research. But they also offer glimpses of a larger unknown.\n\nThe ability to select random items from a large cultural collection may seem trivial. But it opens up opportunities for creativity and engagement that I think are really important. If you agree, you might like to contact the Trove team and let them know — hopefully a bit of randomness might make it into future API upgrades.\n",

				"content_text": "I'm giving a talk in a week or so (eep!) that looks at some of the changing contexts in which the word 'aliens' has been used in Australia. I thought, by way of comparison, it would be useful to do the same for 'immigrants'. While I was playing around with the data last night, I came across something interesting, so here's a sneak preview...\n\n\n### Getting the data\n\nUsing my [TroveHarvester](https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-harvester/) I downloaded the full text of all newspaper articles in Trove that included the word 'immigrants'. I used the `text:` modifier to turn off stemming, and limited the results to the `Article` category. [Here's the query I used.](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/result?l-category=Article&q=text%3Aimmigrants) After the harvest had finished, I had 505,296 text files to play with. \n\nI then used a regular expression — `[\\w,]+(?=\\s+immigrants)` — to find words appearing before the word 'immigrants' in the text files. I found 642,447 occurences across those 505,296 articles.\n\nUsing Pandas I calculated the frequency of each word. [Here's a CSV](https://gist.github.com/wragge/7f663a9133d63371329c5baa8a7f729e) with all the words that have a frequency greater than 100. There's plenty of OCR errors in the mix of course, I haven't tried any cleaning up.\n\n\n### Hmm, that's interesting\n\nFor my talk I'll be looking at words like 'undesirable' and 'prohibited', but the thing that struck me last night were the words describing the ethnic origins of immigrants — 'Chinese', 'German', 'British' etc. I thought I'd have a go at visualising how the use of these terms varied over time. The chart below includes words with an overall frequency greater than 500. The only change I made to the categories was to merge 'scotch' and 'scottish'.\n\nIt's important to remember that this isn't about the number of immigrants arriving in Australia, it's a reflection of **which groups of immigrants were being talked about, and when**. So, for example, 'Chinese immigrants' feature prominently in newspapers of the 1880s as legislation is introduced to restrict their entry to the Australian colonies. \n\nIf you'd like a larger version of this chart, you can [download it here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nzfooyejep6anpb/words_before_immigrants.png?dl=0).\n\n<img src=\"https://updates.timsherratt.org/uploads/2019/d121cf1ffb.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"309\" alt=\"\" />\n",

				"content_html": "<p><strong>Fun fact</strong> — the Porter stemming algorithm treats the words &lsquo;naturalisation&rsquo; and &lsquo;naturalization&rsquo; differently. Naturalisation is stemmed to &lsquo;naturalis&rsquo;, naturalization to &lsquo;natur&rsquo;.
