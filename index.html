         	<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TroveNewsBot">@TroveNewsBot</a> has been sharing Trove newspaper articles on Twitter for over 7 years. With its latest upgrade the bot now has an ‘on this day’ function. Every day at AEST9.00am, TroveNewsBot will share an article published on that day in the past.</p>

<p><img src="uploads/2021/b2b25896d0.jpg" width="600" height="427" alt="" /></p>

<p>Even better, you can make your own ‘on this day&rsquo; queries by tweeting to @TroveNewsBot with the hashtag #onthisday. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tweeting &lsquo;#onthisday #luckydip&rsquo; – will return a random article published on this day in the past.</li>
<li>Tweeting ‘cat #onthisday #luckydip’ – will return a random article about cats published on this day in the past.</li>
<li>Tweeting ‘1920 #year #onthisday’ – will return an article published on this day in 1920.</li>
</ul>

         	<p>In 2014 I pulled together a sample of web pages that included links back to digitised newspaper articles in Trove and created the ‘Trove Traces’ app. It was interesting, and sometimes disturbing, to see the diversity of sites that made use of Trove. Amongst the family and local history enthusiasts were climate change deniers and racists who found ‘evidence&rsquo; for their views in past newspapers. And of course, the sample only includes links in web pages, not social media sharing.</p>

<p><img src="uploads/2021/6f4168855a.jpg" width="600" height="321" alt="" /></p>

<p>The app has since disappeared, but I’ve <a href="https://timsherratt.org/shed/trovetraces/traces/index.html">now published a static version</a>. The search and sort functions won&rsquo;t work, but you can browse through the sample of backlinks by web page or by linked Trove newspaper article. There are also lists of the most frequently occurring pages and articles. #dhhacks</p>

         	<p>I’ve added an API Query Builder to the <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/digitalnz/">DigitalNZ section of the GLAM Workbench</a>. You can use it to learn about the different parameters available from the search API, and experiment with different queries. Just get your API key from DigitalNZ, then try entering keywords and selecting options. Once you understand how the API works, you can start thinking about how you can make use of it in your own projects.</p>

<p>👉🏻 <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/GLAM-Workbench/digitalnz/master?urlpath=voila%2Frender%2Fbuild_api_query.ipynb">Try it out live on Binder!</a></p>

<p>Under the hood the API Query Builder is a Jupyter notebook (of course), but it uses <a href="https://ipyvuetify.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">ipyvuetify</a> to create good-looking, responsive, form widgets. It’s intended to be run using <a href="https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">Voilà</a>, which turns notebooks into interactive apps and dashboards. You can now run any Jupyter notebook <a href="https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deploy.html#deployment-on-binder">using Voilà on Binder</a>, just by changing the url.</p>

<p>If this app seems useful (let me know!) I might put a version on Heroku so the start up time is reduced. I’m also thinking of using this sort of pattern to create apps for other APIs in the GLAM Workbench. #dhhacks</p>

			<h1><a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/01/28/openglam-fireworks-finding.html">OpenGLAM fireworks! Finding open collections in DigitalNZ</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/01/28/openglam-fireworks-finding.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-01-28 11:29:00 &#43;1100">Jan 28, 2021</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Lately I’ve been updating and expanding the notebooks in the <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/digitalnz/">DigitalNZ section</a> of the GLAM Workbench. In particular, I’ve been looking at the <code>usage</code> facet to understand how much of the aggregated content is ‘open’. What do I mean by ‘open’? The <a href="https://opendefinition.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation definition</a> states that ‘open data and content can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose’. Obviously things that are in the public domain, such as out-of-copyright resources, are open. But so are resources with an <a href="https://opendefinition.org/licenses/">open licence</a> such as <a href="https://opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by">CC-BY</a> or <a href="https://opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by-sa">CC-BY-SA</a>. The Creative Commons ‘Non commercial&rsquo; and ‘No derivatives’ licences are <em>not</em> open because they put limits on how you can use resources.</p>

<p>How does this definition map to DigitalNZ? The <code>usage</code> facet includes <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/digitalnz/blob/master/facets/usage.csv">five values</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Share</li>
<li>Modify</li>
<li>Use commercially</li>
<li>All rights reserved</li>
<li>Unknown</li>
</ul>

<p>These values have been assigned by DigitalNZ based on  the <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/digitalnz/blob/master/facets/rights.csv">35,000 different rights statements</a> and <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/digitalnz/blob/master/facets/copyright.csv">30 different copyright statements</a> that are included in DigitalNZ metadata records. I find I have to turn the <code>usage</code> values inside out to really understand them. A resource that only allows you to ‘Share’, excludes the ‘Modify’ and ‘Use commercially’ permissions and so is sort of equivalent to a CC-BY-ND-NC licence. The only open value, according to the definition above, is ‘Use commercially’, which is like CC-BY. I’m assuming that ‘Use commercially’ has been assigned to resources that either out of copyright (or with no known copyright restrictions)  or are openly licensed.</p>

<p>It’s also worth noting that the ‘usage’ values are not mutually-exclusive. A record with a ‘usage’ value of ‘Use commercially’, will also be assigned ‘Share’ and ‘Modify&rsquo; values. This is because ‘Use commercially’ includes the &lsquo;Share&rsquo; and ‘Modify’ permissions. This seems a bit counter-intuitive, but makes sense if you think about doing a search for everything you&rsquo;re allowed to share.</p>

<p>A rough calculation based on the usage facet indicates that 71.76% of the resources aggregated by DigitalNZ are open. That seems pretty good, though a lot of those are probably out-of-copyright newspaper articles from Papers Past. For a more fine-grained analysis, I decided to look at the ‘usage’ data for each combination of ‘content_partner’ and ‘primary_collection’. How open is each individual collection in DigitalNZ?</p>

<p>For added excitement, and to stretch my knowledge of what <a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/">Altair</a> can do, I decided to visualise the results as display of colourful fireworks. The higher the explosion, the more open the collection! I’m pretty pleased with the result.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve saved <a href="http://timsherratt.org/shed/digitalnz/open_collections_digitalnz.html">a HTML version of the chart</a> so you can mouseover the explosions for more details. All the code is <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/digitalnz/#visualising-open-collections-in-digitalnz">included in this notebook</a>, along with a <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/digitalnz/blob/master/facets/usage_by_collection_and_partner.csv">CSV file</a> containing all the harvested facet data. #dhhacks</p>

         	<p>If you like browsing Trove&rsquo;s digitised newspapers page by page, you might have found that the current interface is a bit clunky. To move between pages you have to hover over the page number and click on &lsquo;Next&rsquo; or &lsquo;Previous&rsquo;. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be good if you could just use the arrow keys on your keyboard? Well now you can!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve created a very simple script that allows you to use the arrows on your keyboard to move between pages in Trove&rsquo;s digitised newspapers. Once it&rsquo;s enabled you can use the following shortcuts:</p>

<ul>
<li>⬆️ <strong>Up</strong> arrow – go to the first page of the previous issue</li>
<li>⬇️ <strong>Down</strong> arrow – go the the first page of the next issue</li>
<li>⬅️ <strong>Left</strong> arrow – go to the previous page</li>
<li>➡️ <strong>Right</strong> arrow – go to the next page</li>
</ul>

<p>Go here for <a href="https://gist.github.com/wragge/af8bd20a14005d267ffc759463bd832c">installation instructions</a>.</p>

<p>This makes browsing through a newspaper <em>much</em> easier. Enjoy! #dhhacks</p>

         	<p>There’s a <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-music/">new  GLAM Workbench section</a> for working with data from Trove’s Music &amp; Sound zone!</p>

<p><strong>Inside you&rsquo;ll find out how to harvest all the metadata from ABC Radio National program records – that&rsquo;s 400,000+ records, from 160 Radio National programs, over more than 20 years.</strong></p>

<p>It’s metadata only, so not full transcripts or audio, though there are links back to the ABC site where you might find transcripts. Most records should at least have a title, a date, the name of the program it was broadcast on, a list of contributors, and perhaps a brief abstract/summary. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that many of these records, particularly those from the main current affairs programs, represent individual stories or segments – so they provide a detailed record of the major news stories for the last couple of decades!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-music/#harvest-abc-radio-national-records-from-trove">harvesting notebook</a> shows you how to get the data from the Trove API. There are a number of duplicate records, and some inconsistencies in the way the data is formatted, so the harvesting code tries to clean things up a bit. You can of course adjust this to meet your own needs.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to do the harvesting yourself, there’s <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-music/#abc-radio-national-programs">pre-harvested datasets</a> that you can download immediately from Cloudstor and start exploring. The complete harvest of all 400,000+ records is available both in JSONL (newline separated JSON) and CSV formats. There&rsquo;s also a series of separate datasets for the most frequently occurring programs: RN Breakfast, RN Drive, AM, PM, The World Today, Late Night Live, Life Matters, and the Science Show.</p>

<p>There’s also a <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-music/#exploring-abc-radio-national-metadata">notebook</a> that demonstrates a few possible ways you might start to play with the data – looking at the range of programs, the distribution of records over time, the people involved in each story, and words in the titles of each segment.</p>

         	<p>There are a growing number of non-English newspapers in Trove, but how do you know what&rsquo;s there? After trying a few different approaches, I generated a <a href="https://gist.github.com/wragge/9aa385648cff5f0de0c7d4837896df97">list of 48 newspapers</a> with non-English content.

<p>As the notebook describes, I found the language metadata for newspapers was incomplete, so I used some language detection code on a sample of articles from every newspaper to try and find those with non-English content. But this had its own problems – such as the fact that the language detection code thought that bad OCR looked like Maltese&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="uploads/2021/3ac74cebb8.jpg" width="600" height="225" alt="" /></p>

<p>Anyway, if you’re just searching using English keywords, you might not even be aware that these titles exist. It’s important to explore ways of making diversity visible within large digitised collections. #dhhacks</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Last year I did some analysis of the availability of open access versions of research articles published between 2008 and 2018 in <em>Australian Historical Studies</em>. I&rsquo;ve now broadened this out to cover all individual articles (with a DOI) across a number of journals. It&rsquo;s pretty grim. Despite Green OA policies that allow researchers to share versions of their articles through institutional repositories, Australian history journals still seem to be about 94% closed.</p>

<p>Full details are <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/wragge/ozhist-openaccess/blob/9e1f81cd3917a1a01b2cf4ac6cc376a63c9ff0a3/open_access_versions_australian_hass_journals.ipynb">in this notebook</a>.</p>

<p><strong>But this can be fixed!</strong> If you&rsquo;re in a university, talk to your librarians about depositing a Green OA version of your article in an institutional repository. If not, you can use the <a href="https://shareyourpaper.org/">Share your paper</a> service to upload a Green OA version to Zenodo. Your research will be easier to find, easier to access, easier to cite, and available to everyone – not just those with the luxury of an institutional subscription. #dhhacks</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><strong>Asking questions with web archives – introductory notebooks for historians</strong> has won the British Library Labs Research Award for 2020. <a href="https://data.bl.uk/bl_labs_awards/index.html">The awards</a> recognise &lsquo;exceptional projects that have used the Library’s digital collections and data&rsquo;.</p>

<p>This project gave me a chance to work with web archives collections and staff from the British Library, the National Library of Australia, and the National Library of New Zealand, and was <a href="https://netpreserve.org/projects/jupyter-notebooks-for-historians/">supported</a> by the International Internet Preservation Consortium&rsquo;s Discretionary Funding Program.</p>

<p>We developed a range of tools, examples, and documentation to help researchers use and explore the vast historical resources available through web archives. A new <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/web-archives/">web archives section</a> was added to the GLAM Workbench, and 16 Jupyter notebooks, combining text, images, and live code, were created.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://youtu.be/qhaRQ0LxNAo">30 second summary</a> of the project!</p>

<p>The judges noted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The panel were impressed with the level of documentation and thought that went into how to work computationally through Jupyter notebooks with web archives which are challenging to work with because of their size. These tools were some of the first of their kind.</p>

<p>“The Labs Advisory Board wanted to acknowledge and reward the incredible work of Tim Sherratt in particular. Tim you have been a pioneer as a one-person lab over many years and these 16 notebooks are a fine addition to your already extensive suite in your GLAM Workbench. Your work has inspired so many in GLAM, the humanities community, and BL Labs to develop their own notebooks. To our audience, we strongly recommend that you look at the GLAM Workbench if you’re interested in doing computational experiments with many institutions’ data sources.</p>

<p>Thanks to Andy, Olga, Alex, and Ben for your advice and support. And thanks to the British Library Labs for the award! #dhhacks</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Repositories in the <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/">GLAM Workbench</a> have been launched on <a href="https://mybinder.org/">Binder</a> 3,529 times since the start of this year (according to data from the <a href="https://archive.analytics.mybinder.org">Binder Events log</a>). That’s repository launches, not notebooks. Having launched a repository, users might use multiple notebooks. And of course these stats don’t include people using the notebooks in contexts other than Binder – on their own machines, servers, or services like AARNet’s SWAN. Or just viewing the notebooks in GitHub and copying code into their own projects.</p>

<p>I’m suspicious of web stats, but the Binder data indicates that people have actually done more than ‘visit’ – they’ve spun up a Binder session ready to do some exploration.</p>

<p>Every Jupyter notebook in the GLAM Workbench has a link that opens the notebook in Binder. If you click on the link, Binder reads configuration details from the repository and loads a customised computing environment. All in your browser! That means you can start using the GLAM Workbench without installing any software. Just click on the Binder link and start exploring!</p>

<p>There are about <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/">40 different repositories</a> in the GLAM Workbench, helping you work with data from Trove, DigitalNZ, NAA, SLNSW, NSW Archives, NMA, ArchivesNZ, ANU Archives &amp; more! The image below shows them ranked by number of Binder launches this year.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/web-archives/">web archives section</a> was added this year in collaboration with the IIPC, the UK Web Archive, the Australian Web Archive, and the NZ Web Archive. Its annual number of launches is inflated a bit by the development process. But there’s been 426 launches since it went public in June.</p>

<p>I’m really pleased to see the <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-harvester/">Trove newspaper harvester</a> up near the top. At least once a day (on average) someone’s been firing up the repository to grab Trove newspaper articles in bulk.</p>

<p>Overall, that’s about 11 GLAM Workbench repository launches a day on Binder. It might not seem like much, but that’s 11 research opportunities that didn’t exist before, 11 GLAM collections opened to exploration, 11 researchers building their digital skills…</p>

<p>As humanities researchers continue to learn of the possibilities of GLAM data and develop their digital skills the numbers will grow. It’s a start. And a reminder that not all research infrastructure needs to be built in Go8 unis, by large teams, with $millions. We can all contribute by sharing our tools and methods. #dhhacks</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The Trove Newspaper &amp; Gazette Harvester has been updated to version 0.4.0. The major change is that if the OCRd text for an article isn&rsquo;t available through the API, it will be automatically downloaded via the web interface. What does this mean in practice? Well previously you couldn&rsquo;t harvest OCRd text from the <em>Australian Women&rsquo;s Weekly</em> because it&rsquo;s not included in API results, but now you can!</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t need to do anything differently. If there are AWW articles in your search, and you ask for all the OCRd text using the <code>--text</code> option, the AWW text files will automagically appear in your harvest.</p>

<p>Under the hood, I&rsquo;ve started using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/html2text/">html2text</a> to remove tags from the OCRd text. I think this should produce more consistent results. As previously, line breaks are removed by default from the OCRd text files. However, I&rsquo;ve now added a <code>--include_linebreaks</code> option if you&rsquo;d like to keep them. This generally produces text that is more human-readable, but note that the line breaks produced by OCR aren&rsquo;t always accurate.</p>

<p>Head to the <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-harvester/">GLAM Workbench to try it out</a>, or <a href="https://pypi.org/project/troveharvester/0.4.0/">download the code from PyPi</a>. #dhhacks</p>

         	<p>If you&rsquo;ve done any searching in Trove&rsquo;s digitised newspapers, you&rsquo;ve probably noticed that there aren&rsquo;t many results after 1954. This is basically because of copyright restrictions (though given the complexities of Australia&rsquo;s copyright system, you can&rsquo;t be sure that everything published before 1955 is <em>out</em> of copyright). We can visualise the impact of this by looking at the number of newspaper articles in Trove by year.</p>

<p><img src="uploads/2020/dcf55d9941.jpg" width="600" height="333" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can see why I started referring to it as the <strong>copyright cliff of death</strong>.</p>

<p>But you can also see a little trickle of articles continuing post-1954. The number of newspapers from beyond the copyright cliff of death continues to increase as agreements are made with publishers to put them online. I just checked and there&rsquo;s now 83 newspapers that have at least <em>some</em> post-1954 articles available. Here&rsquo;s the top 10 (by number of articles).</p>

<p><img src="uploads/2020/95e9d27bd6.jpg" width="600" height="223" alt="" /></p>

         	<p>I’ve added a <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/anu-archives/">new section to the GLAM Workbench</a> for the ANU Archives. The first set of notebooks relates to the <a href="http://archivescollection.anu.edu.au/index.php/or59j">Sydney Stock exchange stock and share lists</a>. As the content note describes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These are large format bound volumes of the official lists that were posted up for the public to see - 3 times a day - forenoon, noon and afternoon - at the close of the trading session in the call room at the Sydney Stock Exchange. The closing prices of stocks and shares were entered in by hand on pre-printed sheets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The volumes have been digitised, resulting in a collection of 70,000+ high resolution images. You can browse the details of each volume using <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/anu-archives/blob/master/stock-exchange-details-by-volume.ipynb">this notebook</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve been exploring ways of getting useful, machine-readable data out of the images. There’s more information about the processes involved in <a href="https://github.com/wragge/sydney-stock-exchange">this repository</a>. I’ve also been working on improving the metadata and have managed to assign a date and session (Morning, Noon, or Afternoon) to each page. We these, we can start to explore the content!</p>

<p>One of the notebooks creates a <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/anu-archives/blob/master/stock-exchange-pages-calendar.ipynb">calendar-like view</a> of the whole collection, showing the number of pages surviving from each trading day. This makes it easy to find the gaps and changes in process. #dhhacks</p>

         	<p>Any regular user of RecordSearch, the National Archives of Australia’s online database, will understand its frustrations. But here’s a handy little hack to fix a couple of annoying problems and add some useful functionality!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/wragge/b2af9dc56f7cb0a9476b">RecordSearch Show Pages userscript</a> updates links to digitised files in search results and item details pages, inserting the number of pages in a file. This means that you can easily scan a list of search results to see where the big fat files are, without having to click through to each one individually.</p>

<p>But wait there’s more! The script also rewrites the link to the digitised file viewer so that it opens in the current tab, as you would expect, and not in an annoying pop up window!</p>

<p>And as an extra bonus if you install now, the script also inserts a link on the barcode of an item in the digitised file viewer that takes you back to the item details page. Links to the digitised file viewer are shareable (unlike most RecordSearch links), but they don’t give you a way to find more information about the item. That problem is also fixed by this handy little script.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2020/05/27/new-glam-workbench.html">New GLAM Workbench section on web archives!</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2020/05/27/new-glam-workbench.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-05-27 14:11:25 &#43;1100">May 27, 2020</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>We tend to think of a web archive as a site we go to when links are broken – a useful fallback, rather than a source of new research data. But web archives don&rsquo;t just store old web pages, they capture multiple versions of web resources over time. Using web archives we can observe change – we can ask historical questions.  But web archives store <strong>huge</strong> amounts of data, and access is often limited for legal reasons. Just knowing what data is available and how to get to it can be difficult. Where do you start?</p>

<p>The GLAM Workbench’s <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/web-archives/">new web archives section</a> can help! Here you’ll find a collection of Jupyter notebooks that  document web archive data sources and standards, and walk through methods of harvesting, analysing, and visualising that data. It’s a mix of examples, explorations, apps and tools. The notebooks  use existing APIs to get data in manageable chunks, but many of the examples demonstrated can also be scaled up to build substantial datasets for research – you just have to be patient!</p>

<p>Have you ever wanted to find when a particular fragment of text first appeared in a web page?  Or compare full-page screenshots  of archived sites?  Perhaps you want to explore how the text content of a page has changed over time, or create a side-by-side comparison of web archive captures. There are notebooks to help you with all of these.</p>

<p>To dig deeper you might want to assemble a dataset of text extracted from archived web pages, construct your own database of archived Powerpoint files, or explore patterns within a whole domain. The notebooks provide a range of approaches that can be extended or modified according to your research questions.</p>

<p>The development of these notebooks was supported by the International Internet Preservation Consortium&rsquo;s <a href="http://netpreserve.org/projects/">Discretionary Funding Programme 2019-2020</a>, with the participation of the British Library, the National Library of Australia, and the National Library of New Zealand. #dhhacks</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>For a couple of years I’ve been harvesting datasets created or published by Australian GLAM organisations through government data portals. I’ve just completed <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/glam-data-portals/#results-30-march-2020">the latest harvest</a>, and there’s now 369 datasets, containing 983 files, from 23 GLAM organisations. 628 of these files are in CSV (spreadsheet) format.</p>

<p>There’s a number of ways that you can explore the harvested data. You can <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/glam-datasets-from-gov-portals/">browse a big list of datasets</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/ozglam-data/blob/master/glam-datasets-from-gov-portals.csv">download a CSV</a> containing all the harvested data or <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/ozglam-data/blob/master/glam-datasets-from-gov-portals-csvs.csv">just those formatted as CSVs</a>.</p>

<p>With this harvest I’ve added a <a href="https://ozglam-datasets.glitch.me/data/glam-datasets-from-gov-portals">new way of searching and filtering the harvested data</a> using <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette">Datasette</a> running on Glitch. This interface lets you narrow your queries by field or facet, and search text fields for keywords.</p>

<p>But what’s actually in all those CSV files? If you’d like to start exploring the <em>content</em> of the datasets, then give my <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/csv-explorer/">GLAM CSV Explorer</a> a go! The CSV Explorer looks at each column in the dataset and tries to identify the type of data inside. It then attempts to tell you something useful about it.</p>

<p>For all the details, links, and harvesting code, <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/glam-data-portals/">see the #GLAMWorkbench</a>. #dhhacks</p>

         	<p>Today version 1 of the Trove API was decommissioned. As I <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2019/10/09/creators-and-users.html">explained elsewhere</a>, this meant that a number of Trove Twitter bots also died. The problem is that version 2 of the API provides no easy way to randomly select records. Bots, and other apps that share random content, require major reworking.</p>

<p>After a lot of experimentation, I’ve settled on a few methods for selecting random-ish results. They&rsquo;re far from perfect, but they seem to work reliably. My major concern is that it&rsquo;s hard to know how much of Trove is reachable by these methods. There may be resources that will never be found.</p>

<p>I’ve documented these methods in a <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/trove-random">series of Jupyter notebooks</a> so you can try them out yourself.</p>

</ul>

<p>I’ve used these methods to rework the <a href="https://glitch.com/@wragge">Trove Twitter Bot starter kits</a> on Glitch that many people have used to create their own bots. This makes upgrading bots a pretty easy task. Each of the new starter kits provides instructions for current bot owners on how they can resurrect their creations.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://twitter.com/wragge/lists/trove-bots">feed of Trove bot tweets</a> is looking a little sad tonight. Most of the 43 bots on my list seem to have stopped tweeting. I hope that their owners won&rsquo;t feel discouraged, and will instead take the chance to upgrade their creations. And maybe a few new bots will be created as well.</p>

<h2 id="tl-dr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>Version 1 of the Trove API will be discontinued soon so Trove Twitter bots need to be upgraded. Unfortunately, Version 2 of the Trove API doesn’t support the random selection of resources, so the current behaviour of many bots will change.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>In January 2018, I created a series of templates on Glitch that made it easy for people <a href="https://101dhhacks.net/2018/01/21/trove-bots-for-all/">to build their own Trove Twitter bots</a>. And they did! It was very exciting to see the <a href="https://twitter.com/wragge/lists/trove-bots/members">number of bots grow</a>, and I was particularly pleased by the number of bot builders who professed to being ‘non-coders’. Yay!</p>

<p>Most of these bots share random selections from Trove. This is done by first finding the total number of results in a query, generating a random number between zero and the total, and using the <code>s</code> parameter to retrieve the selected record.</p>

<p>However, Version 2 of the Trove API changed the behaviour of the <code>s</code> parameter to support more efficient bulk harvesting. Using Version 2, it’s not possible to select random records without a lot of additional code, and perhaps not at all.</p>

<p>When Version 2 of the API was released, I let the Trove team know that this change would have a major impact of Twitter bots, and any other application that randomly selects records. I was told this would be looked at before Version 1 of the API was discontinued. As a result I held off updating the bots until the situation was clear.</p>

<p>Version 2.1 of the API was released <a href="https://help.nla.gov.au/sites/default/files/API%20V2.1%20-%20Whats%20Changed%20-%20Full%20Text%20Search%20Release.pdf">a few weeks back</a> with some great new features, but no added randomness. The announcement also noted that Version 1 would be switched off in November. I checked with the Trove team and was told that no changes were planned to the API to support the selection of random records.</p>

<p>So the Twitter bots need some major work, and soon…</p>

<h2 id="possible-solutions">Possible solutions</h2>

<p>First the good news. Version 2 of the API is much faster and more reliable. Also, <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/trove-list-bot">Trove List Bots</a> won’t be affected by this change, as the list items aren’t paginated anyway.</p>

<p>Some random-ish selection of records will still be possible, but it’s going to take a bit of thinking, and the solution won’t be generally applicable across all the bots. The maximum number of results returned by a single API request is 100. So if the bots can use filters and facets to limit their query to less than 100 results, they could then select one at random.</p>

<p>For example, the <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/trove-title-bot">Trove Title Bot</a> (which tweets random articles from a specific newspaper) could be reconfigured to use the decade, year, and month facets to split up the result set. In fact, <a href="https://twitter.com/TroveNewsBot?">TroveNewsBot</a> already does this to try and get around some of the inefficiencies of Version 1 of the API.</p>

<p>Another approach might be to use some sort of random ‘seed’ to limit the query. For example, the Title Bot could select a date at random, and search for articles published on that day.</p>

<p><a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/trove-tag-bot">Tag Bots</a> and <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/trove-collection-bot">Collection Bots</a> will create a different set of challenges. The types of facets and filters that will be most effective will depend, to some extent, on the nature of the collection itself. For example, if the items in the collection were all created at about the same time, then the <code>date</code> filter might not be very useful.</p>

<p>Narrowing down the result set in this way will probably require multiple API requests. And, in many cases, it’s likely that it will be impossible to get the total down below 100. Playing with the sort options might open up this window a bit, but I think that the range of results from which the bots draw their ‘randomly’ selected results will, in most cases, be limited. Some items will never be shared.</p>

<p>Does this matter? People who follow the bots on Twitter might not notice much difference. But the bots’ ability to surface unexpected content will be hampered. They’ll still be sharing records, but they’ll also be hiding some. I think this matters.</p>

<h2 id="the-plan">The plan</h2>

<p>With Version 1 of the API being switched off in November, time is short. I’m also currently in the midst of preparing our house for sale ahead of a move to Tasmania. Eeeek!</p>

<p>I’m planning to create updated versions of all the bot templates on Glitch. They’ll be modified to use Version 2 of the Trove API and I’ll also take the chance to update them to Python 3. I’ll try implementing some of the random-ish strategies described above and see how they work. My aim at this stage is really just to try and keep people’s creations alive and tweeting.</p>

<p>For bot creators/maintainers, the upgrade process should be pretty painless. It should just be a matter of hitting the ‘remix’ button on the updated templates, copying across the configuration details from the current bot, and then adjusting your Cron service to point at the new bot. Of course, if you’ve made any customisations, you’ll have to copy these across to the new code.</p>

<p>As I noted, Collection and Tag bots might require some additional customisation to make sure as much of the collection as possible is exposed.</p>

<p>I’ll document the upgrade process and will be available on Twitter to help. I’m hoping to get this done in the next couple of weeks. Please bear with me…</p>

<h2 id="trovenewsbot-and-trovebot">TroveNewsBot and TroveBot</h2>

<p>I’ll also have to make some changes to <a href="https://twitter.com/TroveNewsBot">TroveNewsBot</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TroveBot">TroveBot</a> which have seen sharing Trove resources with the world since 2013. As with the Glitch bots, their ability to share random items and respond to the #luckydip hashtag will be limited, however, their ability to respond to other queries shouldn’t be affected.</p>

<h2 id="other-apps">Other apps</h2>

<p>There are various other apps that I’ve created over the years that will be affected by this change — most notably the game <a href="http://headlineroulette.net/">Headline Roulette</a>. People who have forked or remixed versions of Headline Roulette will also need to make some changes. I’ll let you know once I’ve worked out what needs to happen.</p>

<h2 id="the-value-of-randomness">The value of randomness</h2>

<p>I’ve written elsewhere about the way Twitter bots can <a href="https://medium.com/open-glam/life-on-the-outside-collections-contexts-and-the-wild-wild-web-4d334ccddee2">mobilise collections</a>, letting them loose in places where people congregate rather than waiting for visitors to find your website. I’ve also talked about the <a href="http://timsherratt.org/blog/muliplication-of-contexts/">value of play</a> in coming to grips with large cultural collections.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Collection bots are versions of ourselves, unable to contain our excitement at our latest discoveries. Look at what I found! They point to the play, to the fun, of research. But they also offer glimpses of a larger unknown.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ability to select random items from a large cultural collection may seem trivial. But it opens up opportunities for creativity and engagement that I think are really important. If you agree, you might like to contact the Trove team and let them know — hopefully a bit of randomness might make it into future API upgrades.</p>

         	<p>NSW State Archives publishes a number of <a href="https://www.records.nsw.gov.au/archives/collections-and-research/guides-and-indexes/indexes-a-z">detailed indexes</a> containing data manually extracted from their records. These provide additional entry points to the records, such as a person&rsquo;s name, or a place. But they also provide useful data for analysis. However, to explore the index data we need to get it out of the web interface and into a form that can be easily downloaded and manipulated.</p>

<p>I’ve created a series of Jupyter notebooks to harvest the all the indexes and save the data in a series of CSV-formatted files. I’ve also updated my repository containing all the harvested CSV files. It’s available from the new <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/nsw-state-archives/">NSW State Archives section</a> of my GLAM Workbench. There are currently 64 different index datasets, containing 1,499,259 rows of data.</p>

<p>And to help you get a sense of what&rsquo;s actually in all those CSV files, I’ve created an interactive Index Explorer. Just select an index from the list, and the Index Explorer will generate a series of tables and visualisations that provide an overview of the data. Try <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/GLAM-Workbench/nsw-state-archives/master?urlpath=%2Fapps%2Findex-explorer.ipynb">running it live</a> on Binder.</p>

<p>Thanks to the State Archives staff and volunteers for preparing all this most excellent data. #dhhacks</p>

         	<p>Over the last week I&rsquo;ve been downloading editorial cartoons published in <em>The Bulletin</em> from @TroveAustralia. There&rsquo;s 3,471 cartoons – at least one from every issue published between 4 Sep 1886 and 17 Sep 1952. And you can browse them all&hellip;</p>

<p>To make it easier to explore the images, I&rsquo;ve compiled them into a series of PDFs – one PDF for each decade. The PDFs include lower resolution versions of the images together with their publication details and a link to Trove. They&rsquo;re all <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rulkbsqgfe8cyhv/AABel9b95buJSG5hZrVCvaQsa?dl=0">available from DropBox</a>:</p>

</ul>

<p>The complete collection of high resolution images (about 60gb in total) can be <a href="https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/bI7hJREvO0oJLGL">downloaded from CloudStor</a>. The names of each image file provide useful contextual metadata. For example, the file name <code>19330412-2774-nla.obj-606969767-7.jpg</code> tells you:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>19330412</code> – the cartoon was published on 12 April 1933</li>
<li><code>2774</code> – it was published in issue number 2774</li>
<li><code>nla.obj-606969767</code> – the Trove identifier for the issue, can be used to make a url eg <code>[nla.gov.au/nla.obj-6...](https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-606969767)</code></li>
<li><code>7</code> – on page 7</li>
</ul>

<p>There&rsquo;s some details of the method that I used to find the cartoons <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/trove-journals/blob/master/Finding_editorial_cartoons_in_the_Bulletin.ipynb">in this notebook</a>. I&rsquo;ve also documented everything in the <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-journals/">Trove Journals section</a> of my GLAM Workbench.</p>

<p>Be warned – the language, images, and ideas presented in <em>The Bulletin</em> were often racist, anti-Semitic, and sexist. You won’t have to look far within this collection to find something offensive. This was, after all, the journal whose slogan for many years was ‘Australia for the white man’. This is our history&hellip; #dhhacks</p>

			<h1><a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2019/02/26/dhhacks-save-a.html">#dhhacks — Save a page image from the State Archives of NSW&#39;s Bubonic Plague Register</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2019/02/26/dhhacks-save-a.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-02-26 18:22:52 &#43;1100">Feb 26, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>So NSW State Archives has digitised the <a href="https://www.records.nsw.gov.au/archives/magazine/bubonic-plague">Register of Cases of Bubonic Plague 1900-1908</a>. Great work! Unfortunately though, they&rsquo;ve put the digitised page images in one of those annoying page-turnery things, without any obvious way of downloading them (please correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong!).</p>

<p>Even more annoyingly, the page-turnery thing disables your browser&rsquo;s right click, so you can&rsquo;t view and save individual images that way either. However, if you&rsquo;re using Firefox there is an easy way to stop sites interfering with your mouse&rsquo;s normal behaviour and restore your right click.</p>

<p><img src="uploads/2019/c999259a20.jpg" width="600" height="334" alt="" /></p>

<p>First enter <code>about:config</code> in your location bar and hit enter. That loads Firefox&rsquo;s configuration settings page. Then find the entry for <code>dom.event.contextMenu.enabled</code> and set it to <code>false</code> by double clicking it. That&rsquo;s it!</p>

<p>Now go to any page in the register. Go to full screen and zoom in to get the biggest image. Right click, and select &lsquo;Save Image As&hellip;&rsquo;. Bingo!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	

<p>I&rsquo;m giving a talk in a week or so (eep!) that looks at some of the changing contexts in which the word &lsquo;aliens&rsquo; has been used in Australia. I thought, by way of comparison, it would be useful to do the same for &lsquo;immigrants&rsquo;. While I was playing around with the data last night, I came across something interesting, so here&rsquo;s a sneak preview&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="getting-the-data">Getting the data</h3>

<p>Using my <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-harvester/">TroveHarvester</a> I downloaded the full text of all newspaper articles in Trove that included the word &lsquo;immigrants&rsquo;. I used the <code>text:</code> modifier to turn off stemming, and limited the results to the <code>Article</code> category. <a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/result?l-category=Article&amp;q=text%3Aimmigrants">Here&rsquo;s the query I used.</a> After the harvest had finished, I had 505,296 text files to play with.</p>

<p>I then used a regular expression — <code>[\w,]+(?=\s+immigrants)</code> — to find words appearing before the word &lsquo;immigrants&rsquo; in the text files. I found 642,447 occurences across those 505,296 articles.</p>

<p>Using Pandas I calculated the frequency of each word. <a href="https://gist.github.com/wragge/7f663a9133d63371329c5baa8a7f729e">Here&rsquo;s a CSV</a> with all the words that have a frequency greater than 100. There&rsquo;s plenty of OCR errors in the mix of course, I haven&rsquo;t tried any cleaning up.</p>

<h3 id="hmm-that-s-interesting">Hmm, that&rsquo;s interesting</h3>

<p>For my talk I&rsquo;ll be looking at words like &lsquo;undesirable&rsquo; and &lsquo;prohibited&rsquo;, but the thing that struck me last night were the words describing the ethnic origins of immigrants — &lsquo;Chinese&rsquo;, &lsquo;German&rsquo;, &lsquo;British&rsquo; etc. I thought I&rsquo;d have a go at visualising how the use of these terms varied over time. The chart below includes words with an overall frequency greater than 500. The only change I made to the categories was to merge &lsquo;scotch&rsquo; and &lsquo;scottish&rsquo;.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that this isn&rsquo;t about the number of immigrants arriving in Australia, it&rsquo;s a reflection of <strong>which groups of immigrants were being talked about, and when</strong>. So, for example, &lsquo;Chinese immigrants&rsquo; feature prominently in newspapers of the 1880s as legislation is introduced to restrict their entry to the Australian colonies.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like a larger version of this chart, you can <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/nzfooyejep6anpb/words_before_immigrants.png?dl=0">download it here</a>.</p>

         	<p>Thanks to the @TroveAustralia API upgrade, the new version of the Trove Newspaper Harvester should be a lot faster. For harvests with full text (but not PDFs which slow things down a lot) I&rsquo;m getting 40-50 articles a second.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2019/01/15/adventures-in-stemming.html">Adventures in stemming, or what happens when you search Trove for &#39;naturalization&#39;</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2019/01/15/adventures-in-stemming.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-01-15 12:46:19 &#43;1100">Jan 15, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><strong>Fun fact</strong> — the Porter stemming algorithm treats the words &lsquo;naturalisation&rsquo; and &lsquo;naturalization&rsquo; differently. Naturalisation is stemmed to &lsquo;naturalis&rsquo;, naturalization to &lsquo;natur&rsquo;. You can try this yourself using this <a href="https://text-processing.com/demo/stem/">NLTK stemming demo</a>.</p>

<p>Why does this matter? If you try <a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/result?q=naturalization">searching for &lsquo;naturalization&rsquo;</a> in Trove you get almost 14 million results, most of which aren&rsquo;t relevant because they&rsquo;re matching words like &lsquo;nature&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Of course you can switch off stemming in Trove by using the <code>text:</code> modifier. A <a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/result?q=text%3Anaturalization">search for <code>text:naturalization</code></a> returns only 17,000 results. But now we&rsquo;ll be missing related terms such as &lsquo;naturalized&rsquo;, so we have to explicity include any forms of the word that we want.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if this applies to other s/z spellings, but given that historical sources (in Australia at least) often tend to use both forms it&rsquo;s something to keep in mind when you&rsquo;re constructing your searches. #dhhacks</p>
