			 <p>The NSW State Archives (now part of <a href="https://mhnsw.au/">Museums of History NSW</a>) publishes a series of <a href="https://mhnsw.au/archive/subjects/?filter=indexes">useful indexes</a> to its collections. The indexes include basic data transcribed from the records, such as names, dates, and places, and provide fine-grained access to the collections. But when they’re explored as data, the indexes also suggest to new ways of analysing, visualising, and linking sets of records. (For some of the possibilities and challenges of using this sort of data see <a href="http://doi.org/10.1353/jwh.2021.0025">Missing Links: Data Stories from the Archive of British Settler Colonial Citizenship</a>).</p>
<p>In 2016, I started harvesting the index data from the NSW State Archives website to make each dataset available as an easily downloadable CSV file. In 2019, changes to the website made it impossible to access the complete indexes, so I was unable to update the CSV files. Fortunately the website has changed again, and I’ve been able to reharvest all the indexes, capturing any changes since 2019. There are currently <strong>75 indexes containing 2,481,881 rows of data</strong>.</p>

			 <p>There have been quite a few GLAM Workbench updates over the last month, here’s some notes. (See <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2023/02/17/maps-people-lists.html">February’s update</a> for more recent changes…)</p>
<h2 id="general-developments">General developments</h2>
<ul>
<li>After many months of work, <strong>all thirteen Trove repositories</strong> within the GLAM Workbench have been updated to include standard configurations, integrations, and basic tests. This will make ongoing development and maintenance much easier. Docker images of every repository are now built automatically whenever the code changes. These images can be used across multiple computing environments, including cloud services such as <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/using-binder/">Binder</a>, <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/using-nectar/">Nectar</a>, and <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/using-reclaim-cloud/">Reclaim Cloud</a>, as well on a <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/using-docker/">local computer</a>. This means users have more options for running the notebooks within a consistent, pre-configured, and tested environment.</li>
<li>With all the Trove repositories now Docker-ised, I worked with the <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/services/ardc-nectar-research-cloud/">Nectar Cloud</a> team to update the <a href="https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000253108-nectar-applications-glam-workbench"><strong>GLAM Workbench app</strong></a>. Now when you install the app, you can select from any of the Trove repositories (excluding API intro and Random items), as well as the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/recordsearch/">NAA RecordSearch</a>, <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/">Web Archives</a>, <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/digitalnz/">Digital NZ</a> and <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/tepapa/">Te Papa</a> repositories.</li>
<li><strong>Datasette Lite integration!</strong> <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-lite">Datasette Lite</a> turns CSV and JSON files into fully searchable databases running within your browser (no server required). I spent some time creating a <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/datasette-lite">customised version of Datasette Lite</a> for the GLAM Workbench. Now all I can just point the urls for CSV datasets to my Datasette Lite repository to open them up for quick exploration – <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/datasette-lite/?csv=https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/trove-journals/blob/master/digital-journals-with-text-20220831.csv#/data/digital-journals-with-text-20220831">like this</a>! I’ve started adding <strong>Explore in Datasette</strong> buttons to dataset pages in the GLAM Workbench. Some examples are mentioned below.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="new-sections">New sections</h2>
<h3 id="trove-contributorshttpsglam-workbenchnettrove-contributors"><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-contributors/">Trove contributors</a></h3>
<p>Trove aggregates metadata from thousands of organisations and projects  around Australia. Data about contributors is available from the <code>/contributor</code> endpoint of the Trove API. This section includes examples of harvesting and exploring this data.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Notebooks:</strong> One notebook <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-contributors/get_contributors/">converts the nested data</a> available from the <code>/contributor</code> endpoint into a single flat list of contributors. Another uses this list to <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-contributors/get_contributors_totals_zone_format/">to find out the number of records contributed by each organisation</a>, aggregated by zone and format.</li>
<li><strong>Datasets</strong>: Three datasets, generated by the code in the notebooks above, are being updated weekly – a <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-contributors/trove-contributors-list/">list of organisations contributing metadata to Trove</a>, a <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-contributors/trove-contributors-zones/">count of records by contributor and zone</a>, and a <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-contributors/trove-contributors-formats/">count of records by contributor, zone, and format</a>. You can explore them using Datasette Lite.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="trove-api-v3httpsglam-workbenchnettrove-api-v3"><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-api-v3/">Trove API v3</a></h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is a temporary section of the the GLAM Workbench created to bring  together information and examples relating to version 3 beta of the Trove  API. It will probably disappear once the new version is officially  released and I reorganise the Trove sections of the GLAM Workbench  accordingly. It currently includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A link to the new <a href="https://troveconsole.herokuapp.com/v3/">v3 beta section of the Trove API Console</a></li>
<li>A <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-api-v3/#summary-of-breaking-changes">summary of breaking changes</a> in the new version – these are the things you&rsquo;ll need to change in your code before v2 of the API is switched off in early 2024.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the coming months I’ll be adding updated notebooks and examples from other Trove sections.</p>
<h2 id="updated-sections">Updated sections</h2>
<h3 id="trove-newspaper--gazette-harvesterhttpsglam-workbenchnettrove-harvester"><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/">Trove newspaper &amp; gazette harvester</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>New notebook!</strong> When I overhauled the <a href="https://wragge.github.io/trove-newspaper-harvester/">trove-newspaper-harvester</a> Python package last year, I made it possible to use the harvester as a library as well as a command line tool. This means you can integrate the harvester into your own tools or workflows. This new notebook, <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/harvest-specific-days/">Harvesting articles that mention &ldquo;Anzac Day&rdquo; on Anzac Day</a>, gives an example of a complex search query where it might be easier to use the harvester as a library – in this case, finding newspaper articles with particular keywords, published on a particular day, over a span of years!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="trove-unpublished-works-diaries-letters-and-archiveshttpsglam-workbenchnettrove-unpublished"><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-unpublished/">Trove unpublished works (diaries, letters, and archives)</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Repository upgraded</strong>: Python packages updated, configuration files standardised, basic tests added, automated Docker builds configured, integrations with Zenodo and Reclaim Cloud added.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New notebooks!</strong> I’ve added a series of notebooks related to finding, using, &amp; analysing the NLA&rsquo;s digitised manuscript finding aids (which are somewhat submerged beneath other content). One notebook, <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-unpublished/find-finding-aids/">finds the finding aids</a>, another one <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-unpublished/get-info-finding-aids/">gathers some summary information</a> about all 2,337 finding aids, and a third helps you <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-unpublished/convert-fa-to-json/">reconstruct the hierarchy from the HTML</a> of a single finding aid &amp; saves the content as JSON.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New datasets!</strong> I used the new finding aids notebooks to generate a couple of datasets. One is just a <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-unpublished/finding-aids-urls/">list of Trove urls</a> pointing to finding aids. The other dataset provides some <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-unpublished/finding-aids-summary/">summary information about each finding aid</a> – this includes the number of items described, digitised, and searchable. You can <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/datasette-lite/?csv=https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/nla-finding-aids-data/blob/main/finding-aids-totals.csv">explore the summary data</a> using Datasette Lite.</p>

<h2 id="related-developments">Related developments</h2>
<p>I’ve also created a couple of new ‘git scrapers’ to capture information about Trove. These are just bits of code that run on a schedule using GitHub actions and save their results into a GitHub repository. Along with the <a href="https://wragge.github.io/trove-newspaper-totals/">Trove Newspaper Data Dashboard</a> and other <a href="https://zenodo.org/communities/trove-historical-data/?page=1&amp;size=20">historical datasets</a>, these help researchers understand how the contents of Trove changes over time.</p>

			 <p>Once again I’ve gotten a bit behind in noting <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/">GLAM Workbench</a> updates, so here’s a quick catch up on some Trove-related changes from the last couple of months.</p>
<h2 id="trove-api-introduction">Trove API introduction</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove/">section that introduces the Trove API</a> (or APIs!) hasn’t had much love over recent years. I’m hoping to add some more content in the coming months, but for now I just did a bit of maintenance – updating Python packages and config files, including tests, and setting up automated builds of Docker containers. The documentation pages have also had a bit of a refresh. More soon!</p>
<h2 id="trove-lists-and-tags">Trove lists and tags</h2>
<p>For the Everyday Heritage digital workshop last November, I added a new notebook to <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/convert-list-to-cb-exhibition/">convert a Trove list into a CollectionBuilder exhibition</a>. The notebook harvests metadata and images from the items in a Trove list, then packages everything up in a form that can be uploaded to a <a href="https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-gh">CollectionBuilder-GH</a> repository. Just upload the files to create your own instant exhibition! For example, <a href="https://wragge.github.io/trove-wragge-list-demo/">this exhibition</a> was generated from this <a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/list/83777">Trove list</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>More recently, I updated and reorganised <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/">the documentation pages</a>. In particular, I updated the links to the pre-harvested datasets which are now all saved in Zenodo:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6827253">Trove lists metadata</a></li>
<li><a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6814722">Trove public tags</a></li>
<li><a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7563995">Trove tag counts</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These datasets have also been added to the <a href="https://zenodo.org/communities/trove-historical-data/?page=1&amp;size=20">Trove historical data collection</a> in Zenodo.</p>
<h2 id="trove-maps">Trove maps</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-maps/">Trove Maps</a> section also needed a refresh and rebuild. The <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-maps/exploring-digitised-maps/">existing notebook</a> harvested metadata about digitised maps to build an overview of what was available. I updated the harvesting code to capture a bit more information, including spatial coordinates where available. These coordinates aren’t available through the API, and aren’t visible on a map’s web page, but they <em>are</em> embedded within the HTML (this is a <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-books/metadata-for-digital-works/">little trick</a> I’ve used with other digitised materials to get additional metadata). You can download the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-maps/single-maps-data/">updated dataset</a>.</p>
<p>I also added a new notebook that attempts to parse the spatial data strings and convert the coordinates into decimal values that we can display on a map. Some of the coordinates were bounding boxes, while others were just points. If there was a bounding box, I calculated the centre point and saved that as well. I ended up with decimal coordinates for 26,591 digitised maps. You can download the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-maps/single-maps-coordinates-data/">parsed and converted coordinates</a> as a dataset.</p>
<p>From this data I was able generate some interesting visualisations. I used <a href="https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/index.html">Folium</a> and the <a href="https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/plugins.html#folium.plugins.FastMarkerCluster">FastMarkerCluster</a> plugin to map all of the centre points. I’ve had trouble before displaying lots of markers in Jupyter, but FastMarkerCluster handled it easily. I also saved the Folium map as <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-maps/trove-map-clusters.html">a HTML page</a> to make it easy for people to explore. Just zoom around and click on markers to display the map’s title and a link to Trove.</p>
<p><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-maps/trove-map-clusters.html"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Where there are bounding boxes, you can overlay the map images themselves on a modern map. Of course, this isn’t as accurate as georectifying the map, particularly if the map doesn’t fill the whole image, but it’s still pretty fun. There’s a demonstration in the notebook that selects a random map and overlays the image on a modern basemap using <a href="https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">IPyleaflet</a>. It includes a widget to adjust the opacity of the map image (something I didn’t seem to be able to include using Folium?).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="trove-people--organisations">Trove People &amp; Organisations</h2>
<p>I’ve finally added a <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-people/">section for the Trove People &amp; Organisations zone</a>! This has been in the works for a while, but thanks to the <a href="https://www.acd-engine.org/">Australian Cultural Data Engine</a> I was able to devote some time to it. Trove&rsquo;s People and Organisations zone aggregates information about  individuals and organisations, bringing multiple sources together under a single identifier. Data is available from a series of APIs, which are not well-documented. The notebooks show you how to <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-people/complete_harvest/">harvest all the available people and organisations data</a> as EAC-CPF encoded XML files. Once you have the data, you can extract some summary information about sources and occupations, and use this to <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-people/intersections/">explore the way that records from different sources have been merged into unique identities</a>. For example you can create a network graph of relationships between sources.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Or use an UpSet chart to show the most common groupings of sources.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There’s also a couple of notebooks with some handy examples of code to <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-people/get_sru_results_as_json/">convert the XML results from the SRU API to JSON</a>, and to <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-people/viaf/">find extra identity links through VIAF</a>. I’ve also shared a pre-harvested version of the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-people/complete_harvest_dataset/">complete dataset</a> and the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-people/aggregated_datasets/">extracted summaries</a>.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2022/12/11/real-face-of.html">Real Face of White Australia – updated site to transcribe records from the National Archives of Australia</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2022/12/11/real-face-of.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-12-11 12:17:57 &#43;1000">Dec 11, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Back in 2017, I worked with students from my <a href="https://2017.exploringdigitalheritage.net/">‘Exploring Digital Heritage’</a> class at the University of Canberra to develop and launch a site to transcribe records from the National Archives of Australia relating to the administration of the White Australia Policy. The highlight was a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-04/white-australia-policy-project-transcribes-history/8868680">weekend-long ‘transcribe-a-thon’</a> held in Kings Hall at Old Parliament House.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This was part of the <a href="https://www.realfaceofwhiteaustralia.net/">Real Face of White Australia</a> project – an ongoing effort by Kate Bagnall and me to increase awareness and understanding of the White Australia Policy records held by the NAA. For an introduction to the project and its origins, see our chapter <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3579530">&lsquo;The people inside&rsquo;</a>, published in <em>Seeing the Past with Computers: Experiments with Augmented Reality and Computer Vision for History</em>, edited by Kevin Kee and Tim Compeau.</p>
<p>The original transcription site was built using <a href="https://scribeproject.github.io/">Scribe</a>, a community transcription platform developed by the New York Public Library and Zooniverse. Unfortunately Scribe is no longer being supported or developed, and, with the infrastructure slowly degrading, I needed to find an alternative before the whole thing fell over.</p>
<p>I decided to use <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/lab">Zooniverse’s Project Builder</a>, which itself is implemented using their <a href="https://panoptes.docs.apiary.io/#">Panoptes API</a>. The basic structure of a Project Builder project is similar to Scribe, with ‘tasks’, ‘workflows’, ‘subjects’, and ‘classifications’. The Project Builder web interface makes it easy to get started, though defining workflows for complicated transcription tasks – like extracting structured information from a form or certificate – can get a bit messy. You can also access the Panoptes API directly, which means you can code your own pipelines for uploading and downloading data from your transcription project.</p>
<p>The documents I uploaded to the new site have no transcriptions from the old system. Some have been digitised since the first site was created. I’m still working through the transcription data from the original site, and will be adding new records over time. At the moment, all the records come from Series ST84/1 – there’s some <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/wragge/the-real-face-of-white-australia/about/research">background information</a> about the records on the projects ‘about’ page.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The new, Zooniverse-powered, <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/wragge/the-real-face-of-white-australia">Real Face of White Australia transcription site</a> was launched on 30 October at a transcription event organised by CAFHOV (<a href="https://www.cafhov.com/">Chinese Australian Family Historians of Victoria</a>). On that first day, 16 volunteers transcribed 880 documents, and they’ve kept going – the total’s now up to 6,749! If you want to help, just <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/wragge/the-real-face-of-white-australia">head along to the site</a> and click on the <strong>Get Started</strong> button!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>All the data extracted by the Real Face of White Australia project is available for further research through <a href="https://github.com/wragge/realface-data">this GitHub repository</a>. You can follow <a href="https://twitter.com/InvisibleAus">@invisibleaus</a> on Twitter for twice-daily mini stories drawn from the transcribed data.</p>

			 <p>October and November brought a flurry of presentations from which I’m still recovering. Here’s a few details and links.</p>
<h2 id="library-of-congress-data-jam">Library of Congress Data Jam</h2>
<p>In October, the <em>Computing Cultural Heritage in the Cloud</em> project at the Library of Congress organised a <a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2022/12/now-playing-the-cchc-data-jam/">Data Jam</a>. I was invited to spend a couple of weeks playing around with one of their datasets and to report on the results. I ended up trying to find references to countries in a collection of 90,000 OCRd books. Of course I struck a few problems along the way, and didn’t get nearly as much done as I’d hoped, but that was really part of the point – to find the problems and explore the possibilities. You can watch a <a href="https://vimeo.com/763639279">video of my presentation</a>, or the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/webcast-10669/?loclr=blogsig">whole Data Jam</a>.</p>

<h2 id="wikimedia-australia-community-meeting">Wikimedia Australia Community Meeting</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Thanks to a grant from Wikimedia Australia, I’ve been able to spend some time this year working to align information about government agencies in Wikidata with details from the National Archives of Australia’s RecordSearch database. You can read about the project in this <a href="https://wikimedia.org.au/wiki/Exploring_government_departments_by_linking_Wikidata_to_the_National_Archives_of_Australia">blog post</a>. In November, I gave a report on the project at Wikimedia Australia’s monthly Community Meeting. You can watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/XkQ_-QgUOBw">video on YouTube</a>. You can also explore the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/wikidata/">new Wikidata section</a> of the GLAM Workbench.</p>
<h2 id="everyday-heritage-workshop-and-symposium">Everyday Heritage workshop and symposium</h2>
<p>November also brought the first of what will be a series of annual symposia relating to the ARC-funded <a href="https://everydayheritage.au/">Everyday Heritage project</a>. On 9 November, Kate Bagnall and I ran a <a href="https://everydayheritage.au/events/workshop-november/">Connecting People and Place</a> workshop at the University of Canberra. We walked participants through some ways of finding and using digital collections such as Trove, and worked with them to create projects based on their own research using <a href="https://storymap.knightlab.com/">StoryMapJS</a> and <a href="https://collectionbuilder.github.io/">CollectionBuilder</a>. You can view the <a href="https://slides.com/wragge/trove-newspapers-tips-tricks">slides of my Trove tips &amp; tricks presentation</a>. In preparation for the workshop I also created a new notebook in the GLAM Workbench that <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#convert-a-trove-list-into-a-collectionbuilder-exhibition">converts a Trove List into a Collection Builder exhibition</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The following day the Everyday Heritage Symposium, <a href="https://everydayheritage.au/news/everyday-heritage-project-2022-public-workshop-and-symposium/">Connecting digital archives people &amp; place</a>, was held at the National Film and Sound Archive in Canberra. You can view the slides from my presentation <a href="https://slides.com/wragge/everyday-heritage-2022">Access to the everyday through digital collections</a>. You can also <a href="https://vimeo.com/776032956">watch a video of the full symposium</a>.</p>
<h2 id="building-dh">Building DH</h2>
<p>On 15 November I took part in a panel discussion on <a href="https://web.cvent.com/event/811e389e-78de-46cd-877d-b20b9ae9ed85/websitePage:ab53bd08-f535-4c29-b2f9-af0b5e31c2d2?RefId=15%20NOV%20Session%2002">Designing user-friendly Platforms and Toolkits for Digital Humanities</a> as part of the Building DH online conference. You can <a href="https://youtu.be/CvWRBjl0VYs">watch the video of the session</a> on YouTube.</p>
<h2 id="capos-2022">CAPOS 2022</h2>
<p>On 16 November I gave the feature presentation at <a href="https://inke.ca/reviewing-revising-and-refining-open-social-scholarship-australasia/">Reviewing, Revising, and Refining Open Social Scholarship: Australasia</a>, and event organised by the Canadian-Australian Partnership for Open Scholarship. My talk, ‘DIY Infrastructure – Building the GLAM Workbench’, described work I’ve been doing over the past year or so to make the GLAM Workbench more sustainable by automating and standardising basic tasks, and integrating it with a range of existing services and tools. You can view <a href="https://echo360.ca/media/14297fe8-2a18-4f60-9da6-5986fde1fcfb/public">the video of my talk</a>, or <a href="https://slides.com/wragge/capos22">browse the slides</a>.</p>

			 <p><em><a href="https://scholarly.info/book/the-australian-history-industry/">The Australian History Industry</a></em> was published recently. Edited by Paul Ashton and Paula Hamilton, the book ‘explores the complex, multi-roomed house of Australian history’, exploring academic, school, and public history, the impact of digital technologies, and the relationship of history to memory, social justice, politics, and cultural practice.</p>
<p>My chapter ‘Digital revolutions: The limits and affordances of online collections’ looks at how digitisation of GLAM collections has (and hasn’t) changed historical practice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the COVID lockdowns in 2020 emphasised, the online availability of  primary source materials makes historical research possible even when  access to the originals is limited. But the undoubted convenience of  being able to browse 200 years worth of newspapers at home masks other  issues that historians have been slow to acknowledge and address. How do we discover relevant resources? What gets digitised and why? How can  researchers use these collections to ask new types of questions? After more than 25 years, the web has its own history. What problems and  possibilities has it brought to the way we understand the past?</p>

			 <p>The Trove Newspaper Harvester has been around in different forms for more than a decade. It helps you download all the articles in a <a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/">Trove</a> newspaper search, opening up new possibilities for large-scale analysis. You can use it as a command-line tool by installing a Python package, or through the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/">Trove Newspaper Harvester</a> section of the GLAM Workbench.</p>
<p>I’ve just overhauled development of the Python package. The new <a href="https://github.com/wragge/trove-newspaper-harvester">trove-newspaper-harvester</a> replaces the old <a href="https://github.com/wragge/troveharvester">troveharvester</a> repository. The command-line interface remains the same (with a few new options), so it’s really a drop in replacement. <a href="https://wragge.github.io/trove-newspaper-harvester/"><strong>Read the full documentation</strong></a> of the new package for more details.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here’s a summary of the changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the package can <strong>now be used as a <a href="https://wragge.github.io/trove-newspaper-harvester/core.html">library</a></strong> (that you incorporate into your own code) as well as a standalone <a href="https://wragge.github.io/trove-newspaper-harvester/cli.html">command-line tool</a> – this means you can embed the harvester in your own tools or workflows</li>
<li>both the library and the CLI now let you set the names of the directories in which your harvests will be saved – this makes it easier to organise your harvests into groups and give them meaningful names</li>
<li>the harvesting process now <a href="https://wragge.github.io/trove-newspaper-harvester/core.html#results">saves results</a> into a newline-delimited JSON file (one JSON object per line) – the library has a <code>save_csv()</code> option to convert this to a CSV file, while the CLI automatically converts the results to CSV to maintain compatibility with previous versions</li>
<li>behind the scenes, the package is now developed and maintained using <a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/">nbdev</a> – this means the code and documentation are all generated from a set of Jupyter notebooks</li>
<li>the Jupyter notebooks include a variety of automatic tests which should make maintenance and development much easier in the future</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve also updated the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/">Trove Newspaper Harvester section</a> of the GLAM Workbench to use the new package. The new core library will make it easier to develop more complex harvesting examples – for example, searching for articles from a specific day across a range of years.

			 <p>A few weeks ago I <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2022/09/01/making-nsw-postal.html">created a new search interface</a> to the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/nsw-post-office-directories/">NSW Post Office Directories from 1886 to 1950</a>. Since then, I’ve used the same process on the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/sydney-telephone-directories/">Sydney Telephone Directories from 1926 to 1954</a>. Both of these publications had been digitised by the State Library of NSW and made available through Trove. To build the new interfaces I downloaded the text from Trove, indexed it by line, and linked it back to the online page images.</p>
<p>But there are similar directories from other states that are not available through Trove. The Tasmanian Post Office Directory, for example, has been <a href="https://stors.tas.gov.au/ILS/SD_ILS-981598">digitised between 1890 and 1948</a> and made available as 48 individual PDF files from Libraries Tasmania. While it’s great that they’ve been digitised, it’s not really possible to search them without downloading all the PDFs.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href="https://everydayheritage.au/">Everyday Heritage</a> project, <a href="https://katebagnall.com/">Kate Bagnall</a> and I are working on mapping Tasmania’s Chinese history – finding new ways of connecting people and places. The Tasmanian Post Office Directories will be a useful source for us, so I thought I’d try converting them into a database as I had with the NSW directories. But how?</p>
<p>There were several stages involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Downloading the 48 PDF files</li>
<li>Extracting the text and images from the PDFs</li>
<li>Making the separate images available online so they could be integrated with the search interface</li>
<li>Loading all the text and image links into a SQLite database for online delivery using Datasette</li>
</ul>
<p>And here’s the result!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/tasmanian-post-office-directories/"><strong>Search for people and places in Tasmania from 1890 to 1948!</strong></a></p>
<p>The complete process is documented in a <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/libraries-tasmania/#tasmanian-post-office-directories">series of notebooks</a>, shared through the brand new <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/libraries-tasmania/">Libraries Tasmania section</a> of the GLAM Workbench. As with the NSW directories, the processing pipeline I developed could be reused with similar publications in PDF form. Any suggestions?</p>
<h2 id="some-technical-details">Some technical details</h2>
<p>There were some interesting challenges in connecting up all the pieces. <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/libraries-tasmania/tas-pod-save-text-images/">Extracting the text and images from the PDFs</a> was remarkably easy using <a href="https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PyMuPDF</a>, but the quality of the text wasn’t great. In particular, I had trouble with columns – values from neighbouring columns would be munged together, upsetting the order of the text. I tried working with the positional information provided by PyMuPDF to improve column detection, but every improvement seemed to raise another issue. I was also worried that too much processing might result in some text being lost completely.</p>
<p>I tried a few experiments re-OCRing the images with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/textract/">Textract</a> ( a paid service from Amazon) and <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract">Tesseract</a>. The basic Textract product provides good OCR, but again I needed to work with the positional information to try and reassemble the columns. On the other hand, Tesseract’s automatic layout detection seemed to work pretty well with just the default settings. It wasn’t perfect, but good enough to support search and navigation. So I decided to <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/libraries-tasmania/tas-pod-ocr-with-tesseract/">re-OCR all the images using Tesseract</a>. I’m pretty happy with the result.</p>
<p>The search interfaces for the NSW directories display page images loaded directly from Trove into an <a href="https://openseadragon.github.io/">OpenSeadragon viewer</a>. The Tasmanian directories have no online images to integrate in this way, so I had to set up some hosting for the images I extracted from the PDFs. I could have just loaded them from an Amazon s3 bucket, but I wanted to use IIIF to deliver the images. Fortunately there’s a great project that uses Amazon’s Lambda service to provide a <a href="https://github.com/samvera-labs/serverless-iiif">Serverless IIIF Image API</a>. To prepare the images for IIIF, you convert them to pyramidal TIFFs (a format that contains an image at a number of different resolutions) using <a href="https://github.com/libvips/libvips">VIPS</a>. Then you upload the TIFFs to an s3 bucket and point the Serverless IIIF app at the bucket. There’s <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/libraries-tasmania/tas-pod-upload-images/">more details in this notebook</a>. It’s very easy and seems to deliver images amazingly quickly.</p>
<p>The rest of the processing followed the process I used with the NSW directories – <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/libraries-tasmania/tas-pod-add-to-datasette/">using SQLite-utils and Datasette to package the data</a> and deliver it online via Google Cloudrun.</p>
<h2 id="postscript-time-and-money">Postscript: Time and money</h2>
<p>I thought I should add a little note about costs (time and money) in case anyone was interested in using this workflow on other publications. I started working on this on Sunday afternoon and had a full working version up about 24 hours later – that includes a fair bit of work that I didn’t end up using, but doesn’t include the time I spent re-OCRing the text a day or so later. This was possible because I was reusing bits of code from other projects, and taking advantage of some awesome open-source software. Now that the processing pipeline is pretty well-defined and documented it should be even faster.</p>
<p>The search interface uses cloud services from Amazon and Google. It’s a bit tricky to calculate the precise costs of these, but here’s a rough estimate.</p>
<p>I uploaded 63.9gb of images to Amazon s3. These should cost about US$1.47 per month to store.</p>
<p>The Serverless IIIF API uses Amazon’s Lambda service. At the moment my usage is within the free tier, so $0 so far.</p>
<p>The Datasette instance uses Google Cloudrun. Costs for this service are based on a combination of usage, storage space, and the configuration of the environment. The size of the database for the Tasmanian directories is about 600mb, so I can get away with 2gb of application memory. (The NSW Post Office directory currently uses 8gb.) These services scale to zero – so basically they shut down if they’re not being used. This saves a lot of money, but means there can be a pause if they need to start up again. I’m running the Tasmanian and NSW  directories, as well as the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/name-search/">GLAM Name Index search</a>, within the same Google Cloud account, and I’m not quite sure how to itemise the costs. But overall, it’s costing me about US$4.00 a month to run them all. Of course if usage increases, so will the costs!</p>
<p>So I suppose the point is that these sorts of approaches can be quite a practical and cost-effective way of improving access to digitised resources, and don’t need huge investments in time or infrastructure.</p>
<p>If you want to contribute to the running costs of the NSW and Tasmanian directories you can <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/wragge?o=esb">sponsor me on GitHub</a>.</p>

		<a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2022/09/05/fresh-harvest-of.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-09-05 16:13:16 &#43;1000">Sep 5, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’ve updated the GLAM Workbench’s harvest of OCRd text from Trove&rsquo;s digitised periodicals. This is a completely fresh harvest, so should include any corrections made in recent months. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>1,430 periodicals</li>
<li>OCRd text from 41,645 issues</li>
<li>About 9gb of text</li>
</ul>
<p>The easiest way to explore the harvest is probably this <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/journals-with-ocr/">human-readable list</a>. The list of periodicals with OCRd text is also <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/csv-journals-with-ocr/">available as a CSV</a>. You can find <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/ocrd-text-all-journals/">more details</a> in the Trove journals section of the GLAM Workbench, and <a href="https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/QOmnqpGQCNCSC2h">download the complete corpus</a> from CloudStor.</p>
<p>Finding which periodical issues in Trove have OCRd text you can download is not as easy as it should be. The <code>fullTextInd</code> index doesn&rsquo;t seem to distinguish between digitised works (with OCR)  and born-digital publications (like PDFs) without downloadable text. You can use <code>has:correctabletext</code> to find articles with OCR, but you can&rsquo;t get a full list of the periodicals the articles come from using the <code>title</code> facet. As <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/create-list-digitised-journals/">this notebook explains</a>, you can search for <code>nla.obj</code>, but this returns both digitised works and publications supplied through edeposit. In previous harvests of OCRd text I processed all of the  titles returned by the <code>nla.obj</code> search, finding out whether  there was any OCRd text by just requesting it and seeing what came back. But the number of non-digitised works on the list of periodicals in  digital form has skyrocketed through the edeposit scheme and this  approach is no longer practical. It just means you waste a lot of time  asking for things that don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>For the latest harvest I took a different approach. I only processed periodicals in digital form that <em>weren&rsquo;t</em> identified as coming through edeposit. These are the publications with a <code>fulltext_url_type</code> value of either &lsquo;digitised&rsquo; or &lsquo;other&rsquo; in my <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/csv-digital-journals/">dataset of digital periodicals</a>. Is it possible that there&rsquo;s some downloadable text in edeposit works  that&rsquo;s now missing from the harvest? Yep, but I think this is a much  more sensible, straightforward, and reproduceable approach.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the only problem. As I noted when creating the list of  periodicals in digital form, there are duplicates in the list, so they  have to be removed. You then have to find information about the issues  available for each title. This is not provided by the Trove API, but  there is an internal API used in the web interface that you can access – see <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/get-ocrd-text-from-digitised-journal/">this notebook for details</a>. I also noticed that sometimes where there&rsquo;s a single issue of a title,  it&rsquo;s presented as if each page is an issue. I think I&rsquo;ve found a work  around for that as well.</p>
<p>All these doubts, inconsistencies and workarounds mean that I&rsquo;m fairly certain I don&rsquo;t have <em>everything</em>. But I do think I have <em>most</em> of the OCRd text available from digitised periodicals, and I do have a  methodology, <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/get-ocrd-text-from-all-journals/">documented in this notebook</a>, that at least provides a  starting point for further investigation. As I noted in my <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2022/05/11/my-trove-researcher.html">wishlist for a Trove Researcher Platform</a>, it would be great if more  metadata for digitised works, other than newspapers, was made available  through the API.</p>

			 <p>As part of my work on the <a href="https://everydayheritage.au/about/">Everyday Heritage</a> project I’m looking at how we can make better use of digitised collections to explore the everyday experiences woven around places such as Parramatta Road in Sydney. For example, the NSW Postal Directories from <a href="https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-518308191">1886 to 1908</a> and <a href="https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-522689844">1909 to 1950</a> have been digitised by the State Library of NSW and made available through Trove.  The directories list residences and businesses by name and street location. Using them we can explore changes in the use of Parramatta Road across 60 years of history. But there’s a problem. While you can browse the directories page by page, searching is clunky. Trove’s main search indexes the contents of the directories by ‘article’. Each ‘article’ can be many pages long, so it’s difficult to focus in on the matching text. Clicking through from the search results to the digitised volume lands you in another set of search results, showing all the matches in the volume. However, the internal search index  works differently to the main Trove index. In particular it doesn’t seem to understand phrase or boolean searches. If you start off searching for “parramatta road” , Trove tells you there’s 50 matching articles, but if you click through to a volume you’re told there’s no results. If you remove the quotes you get every match for ‘parramatta’ or ‘road’. It’s all pretty confusing.</p>
<p>The idea of ‘articles’ is really not very useful for publications like the Post Office Directories where information is mostly organised by column, row or line. You want to be able to search for a name, and go directly to the line in the directory where that name is mentioned. And now you can! Using Datasette, I’ve created an interface that searches <em>by line</em> across all 54 volumes of the NSW Post Office Directory from 1886 to 1950 (that’s over 30 million lines of text).</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>There were a few stages involved in creating this resource, but mostly I was able to reuse bits of code from the GLAM Workbench’s Trove <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/">journals</a> and <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-books/">books</a> sections, and other related projects such as the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/name-search/">GLAM Name Index Search</a>. Here’s a summary of the processing steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>I started with the two top-level entries for the NSW Postal Directories, harvesting details of the 54 volumes under them.</li>
<li>For each of these 54 volumes, I downloaded the OCRd text <strong>page by page</strong>. Downloading the text by page, rather than volume, was very slow, but I thought it was important to be able to link each line of text back to its original page.</li>
<li>To create links back to pages, I also needed the individual identifiers for each page. A list of page identifiers is embedded as a JSON string within each volume’s HTML, so I extracted this data and matched the page ids to the text.</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/">sqlite-utils</a>, I created a SQLite database with a separate table for every volume. Then I processed the text by volume, page, and line – adding each line line of text and its page details as a individual record in the database.</li>
<li>I then ran full text indexing across each line to make it easily searchable.</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> and its <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-search-all">search-all plugin</a>, I loaded up the database and BINGO! More than 30 million lines of text across 54 digitised volumes were instantly searchable.</li>
<li>To make it all public, I used Datasette’s <code>publish</code> function to push the database to Google’s Cloudrun service.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/create-text-db-indexed-by-line/">All the code is available in the journals section</a> of the GLAM Workbench.</p>
<h2 id="future-developments">Future developments</h2>
<p>One of the most exciting things to me is that this processing pipeline can be used with any digitised publication on Trove where it would be easier to search by line rather than article. Any suggestions?</p>

			 <p>You might have noticed some changes to the web archives section of the GLAM Workbench.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I’m very excited to announce that the <a href="https://www.bl.uk/">British Library</a> is now sponsoring the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/">web archives section</a>! Many thanks to the British Library and the <a href="https://www.webarchive.org.uk/">UK Web Archive</a> for their support – it really makes a difference.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/">web archives section</a> was developed in 2020 with the support of the International Internet Preservation Consortium&rsquo;s <a href="http://netpreserve.org/projects/">Discretionary Funding Programme</a>, in collaboration with the British Library, the National Library of Australia, and the National Library of New Zealand. It’s intended to help historians, and other researchers, understand what sort of data is available through web archives, how to get it,  and what you can do with it. It provides a series of tools and examples that document existing APIs, and explore questions such as how web pages change over time. The notebooks focus on four particular web archives: the <a href="https://www.webarchive.org.uk/">UK Web Archive</a>, the <a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/website">Australian Web Archive</a> (National Library of Australia ), the <a href="https://natlib.govt.nz/collections/a-z/new-zealand-web-archive">New Zealand Web Archive</a> (National Library of New Zealand), and the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Internet Archive</a>. However, the tools and approaches could be easily extended to other web archives (and soon will be!). I introduced the web archives section of the GLAM Workbench in this seminar for the IIPC in August 2020:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>According to the <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/06/13/some-glam-workbench.html">Binder launch stats</a>, the web archives section is the most heavily used part of the GLAM Workbench. In December 2020, it <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2020/12/16/glam-workbench-wins.html">won the British Library Labs Research Award</a>. Last year I <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/05/17/web-archives-section.html">updated the repository</a>, automating the build of Docker images, and adding integrations with Zenodo, Reclaim Cloud, and <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/10/21/glam-workbench-now.html">Australia’s Nectar research cloud</a>. I’m also thinking about some new notebooks – watch this space!</p>
<p>The GLAM Workbench <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/about/#how-is-the-glam-workbench-funded">receives no direct funding</a> from government or research agencies, and so the support of sponsors like the British Library and all my other <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/get-involved/supporters/">GitHub sponsors</a> is really important. <strong>Thank you!</strong> If you think this work is valuable, have a look at the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/get-involved/">Get involved!</a> page to see how you can contribute.

<p>The <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/glam-data-portals/">GLAM data from government portals</a> section of the GLAM Workbench provides more information and a summary of results.  For example, here’s a list of the number of data files by GLAM institution.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Most of the datasets are in CSV format, and most have a CC-BY licence.</p>
<h2 id="whats-inside">What’s inside?</h2>
<p>Obviously it’s great that GLAM organisations are sharing lots of open data, but what’s actually inside all of those CSV files? To help you find out, I created the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/csv-explorer/">GLAM CSV Explorer</a>. Click on the blue button to run it in Binder, then just select a dataset from the dropdown list. The CSV Explorer will download the file, and examine the contents of every field to try and determine the type of data it holds – such as text, dates, or numbers. It then summarises the results and builds a series of visualisations to give you an overview of the dataset.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="search-for-names">Search for names</h2>
<p>Many of the datasets are name indexes to collections of records – GLAM staff or volunteers have transcribed the names of people mentioned in records as an aid to users. For Family History Month last year I aggregated all of the name indexes and made them searchable through a single interface using Datasette. The <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/name-search/">GLAM Name Index Search</a> has been updated as well – it searches across 10.3 million records in 253 indexes from 10 GLAM organisations. And it’s free!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="and-a-bit-of-maintenance">And a bit of maintenance…</h2>
<p>As well as updating the data, I also updated <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/ozglam-data">the code repository</a> adding the features that I’m rolling out across the whole of the GLAM Workbench. This includes automated Docker builds saved to Quay.io, integrations with Reclaim Cloud and Zenodo, and some basic quality controls through testing and code format checks.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve made a small change to the Zotero translator for the National Library of Australia&rsquo;s catalogue. Now, if there&rsquo;s a link to a digitised version of the work in Trove, that link will be saved in Zotero&rsquo;s <code>url</code> field. This makes it quicker and easier to view digitised items – just click on the &lsquo;URL&rsquo; label in Zotero to open the link.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also handy if you&rsquo;re viewing a digitised work in Trove and want to capture the metadata about it. Just click on the &lsquo;View catalogue&rsquo; link in the details tab of a Trove item, then use Zotero to save the details from the catalogue.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The metadata for digitised books and journals in Trove can seem a bit sparse, but there&rsquo;s quite a lot of useful metadata embedded within Trove&rsquo;s web pages that isn&rsquo;t displayed to users or made available through the Trove API. This <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-books/metadata-for-digital-works/">notebook</a> in the GLAM Workbench shows you how you can access it. To make it even easier, I&rsquo;ve added a new endpoint to my <a href="https://trove-proxy.herokuapp.com/">Trove Proxy</a> that returns the metadata in JSON format.</p>
<p>Just pass the url of a digitised book or journal as a parameter named <code>url</code> to <code>https://trove-proxy.herokuapp.com/metadata/</code>. For example:</p>
<p><a href="https://trove-proxy.herokuapp.com/metadata/?url=https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-2906940941">https://trove-proxy.herokuapp.com/metadata/?url=https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-2906940941</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ve created a simple bookmarklet to make it simpler to open the proxy. To use it just:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag this link to your bookmarks toolbar: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Get Trove work metadata<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li>View a digitised book or journal in Trove.</li>
<li>Click on the bookmarklet to view the metadata in JSON format.</li>
</ul>
<p>To view the JSON data in your browser you might need to install an extension like <a href="https://jsonview.com/">JSONView</a>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I was looking at my <a href="https://wragge.github.io/trove-newspaper-totals/">Trove Newspapers Data Dashboard</a> again last night trying to figure out why the number of newspaper articles from NSW seemed to have dropped by more than 700,000 since my harvesting began. It took me a while to figure out, but it seems that the search index was rebuilt on 31 May, and that caused some major shifts in the distribution of articles by state, as reported by the main <code>result</code> API. So the indexing of the articles changed, not the actual number of articles. Interestingly, the number of articles by state reported by the <code>newspaper</code> API doesn&rsquo;t show the same fluctuations.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This adds another layer of complexity to understanding how Trove changes over time. To try and document such things, I&rsquo;ve added a &lsquo;Significant events&rsquo; section to the Dashboard. I&rsquo;ve also included a new &lsquo;Total articles by publication state&rsquo; section that compares results from the <code>result</code> and <code>newspaper</code> APIs. This should make it easier to identify such issues in the future.</p>
<p>Stay alert people – remember, search interfaces lie!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>There’s been lots of small updates to the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/">GLAM Workbench</a> over the last couple of months and I’ve fallen behind in sharing details. So here’s an omnibus list of everything I can remember…</p>
<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wragge/trove-newspaper-totals">Weekly harvests of basic Trove newspaper data</a> continue, there&rsquo;s now about three months worth. You can view a summary of the harvested data through the <strong>brand new</strong> <a href="https://wragge.github.io/trove-newspaper-totals/">Trove Newspaper Data Dashboard</a>. The Dashboard is generated from a Jupyter notebook and is updated whenever there’s a new data harvest.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s also <a href="https://github.com/wragge/naa-recently-digitised">weekly harvests of files digitised by the NAA</a>, now 16 months worth of data.</li>
<li>Updated harvest of <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6814722">Trove public tags</a> (Zenodo) – includes 2,201,090 unique public tags added to 9,370,614 resources in Trove between August 2008 and July 2022.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve started moving other pre-harvested datasets out of the GLAM Workbench code repositories, into their own data repositories. This means better versioning and citability. The first example is the list of Trove newspapers with articles post the 1955 copyright cliff of death – here&rsquo;s the <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/trove-newspapers-data-post-54/">GH repo</a>, and the <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6812811">Zenodo record</a>.</li>
<li>To bring together datasets that provide historical data about Trove itself, I&rsquo;ve created a <a href="https://zenodo.org/communities/trove-historical-data/?page=1&amp;size=20">Trove historical data</a> community on Zenodo. Anyone&rsquo;s welcome to contribute. There&rsquo;s much more to come.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>Tag cloud generated from the latest harvest of Trove Tags</em></p>
<h3 id="code">Code</h3>
<ul>
<li>Big thanks to Mitchell Harrop who contributed a new <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/heritage-council-of-victoria/">Heritage Council of Victoria section</a> to the GLAM Workbench providing examples using the Victorian Heritage Database API.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://pypi.org/project/troveharvester/"><code>troveharvester</code> Python package</a> has been updated. Mainly to remove annoying Pandas warnings and to make use of the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/trove-query-parser/"><code>trove-query-parser</code></a> package.</li>
<li>As a result of the above, the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/">Trove Newspaper &amp; Gazette Harvester section</a> of the GLAM Workbench has been updated. No major changes to notebooks, but I&rsquo;ve implemented basic testing and linting to improve code quality.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/">Trove newspapers section</a> of the GW has been updated. There were a few bug fixes and minor improvements. In particular there was a problem downloading data and HTML files from QueryPic, and some date queries in QueryPic were returning no results.</li>
<li>The tool to <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#download-a-page-image">download complete, high-res newspaper page images</a> has been updated so that you now no longer need to supply an API key. Also fixed a problem with displaying the images in Voila.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://pypi.org/project/recordsearch-data-scraper/"><code>recordsearch_data_scraper</code> Python package</a> has been updated. This fixes a bug where agency and series searches with only one result weren&rsquo;t being captured properly.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/recordsearch/">RecordSearch section</a> of the GW has been updated. This is incorporates the above update, but I took the opportunity to update all packages, and implement basic testing and linting. The <strong>Harvest items from a search in RecordSearch</strong> notebook has been simplified and reorganised. There are two new notebooks: <strong>Exploring harvested series data, 2022</strong> – generates some basic statistics from the harvest of series data in 2022 and compares the results to the previous year; <strong>Summary of records digitised in the previous week</strong> – run this notebook to analyse the most recent dataset of recently digitised files, summarising the results by series.</li>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’ve created a <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> translator for the <a href="https://libraries.tas.gov.au/Pages/Home.aspx">Libraries Tasmania</a> catalogue. Using it, you can save metadata and digital resources to your own research database with a single click. Libraries Tasmania actually has three catalogues rolled into one – the main library catalogue, the Archives catalogue, and the Names Index. The translator works across all three. Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select and save items from a page of search results.</li>
<li>Save individual items across the full range of formats. (By default, individual records in the catalogue open in a modal overlay. For Zotero to recognise the item you need to click on the <strong>Permalink</strong> button and open the record on a separate page.)</li>
<li>Automatically download digital images and PDFs attached to records. This works when the record points to a particular page – it won’t download multiple images from a single link. However, if a record contains multiple links to digitised pages (such as the Convict records in the Names Index), you’ll get them all!</li>
<li>Fields in the Archives catalogue and Name Index that don’t map to Zotero properties are saved as key/value pairs in Zotero’s ‘Extra’ field</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The translator is now included in the main Zotero repository so should install and update itself automatically. If the Zotero browser extension doesn&rsquo;t seem to be detecting Libraries Tasmania items you can force an update by right clicking on the Zotero icon in your browser toolbar and clicking on <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced</strong> &gt; <strong>Update translators</strong>.</p>
<p>My work on this translator was not entirely altruistic – it&rsquo;s going to be very useful in the <a href="https://everydayheritage.au/">Everyday Heritage</a> project as <a href="http://katebagnall.com/">Kate Bagnall</a> and I try to bring together sources relating to Chinese heritage in Tasmania.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m also very happy to be able to update my spreadsheet of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zb_e9ZazP4zs-K8ZcbaTCnv6cO_OgmUx4A7U4MFyOFE/edit?usp=sharing">Zotero support in Australian GLAM organisations</a> and put Libraries Tasmania in the green! #dhhacks</p>

			 <p>I’ve created a Zotero translator for the <a href="https://libraries.tas.gov.au/Pages/Home.aspx">Libraries Tasmania</a> catalogue. Using it, you can save metadata and digital resources to your own research database with a single click. Libraries Tasmania actually has three catalogues rolled into one – the main library catalogue, the archives catalogue, and the names index. The translator works across all three. Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select and save items from a page of search results.</li>
<li>Save individual items across the full range of formats. (By default, individual records in the catalogue open in a modal overlay. For Zotero to recognise the item you need to click on the <strong>Permalink</strong> button and open the record on a separate page.)</li>
<li>Automatically download digital images and PDFs attached to records. This works when the record points to a particular page – it won’t download multiple images from a single link. However, if a record contains multiple links to digitised pages (such as the Convict records in the Names Index), you’ll get them all!</li>
<li>Fields in the Archives catalogue and Name Index that don’t map to Zotero properties are saved as key/value pairs in Zotero’s ‘Extra’ field</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I’ve submitted the translator for inclusion in the official repository, but you’re welcome to take it for a test run in the meantime. Just follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find out where your Zotero data folder is. From Zotero go to <strong>Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Advanced &gt; Files and Folders</strong> and click on <strong>Show Data Directory</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wragge/translators/librariestas/Libraries%20Tasmania.js">Open the translator file here</a>. Then right click and choose <strong>Save as</strong>, navigate to your Zotero data folder, and save it in the &lsquo;translators&rsquo; folder.</li>
<li>Restart Zotero and your browser.</li>
<li>Head to the Libraries Tasmania catalogue and try it!</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me know if you strike any problems. #dhhacks</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>If you have a dataset that you want to share as a searchable online database then check out <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> – it’s a fabulous tool that provides an ever-growing range of options for exploring and publishing data. I particularly like how easy Datasette makes it to publish datasets on cloud services like Google’s Cloudrun and Heroku. A couple of weekends ago I migrated the <a href="https://resources.chineseaustralia.org/tung_wah_newspaper_index">TungWah Newspaper Index</a> to Datasette. It’s now running on Heroku, and I can push updates to it in seconds.</p>
<p>I’m also using Datasette as the platform for sharing data from the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/anu-archives/">Sydney Stock Exchange Project</a> that I’m working on with the ANU Archives. There’s a lot of data – more than 20 million rows – but getting it running on Google Cloudrun was pretty straightforward with Datasette’s <code>publish</code> command. The problem was, however, that Datasette is configured to run on most cloud services in ‘immutable’ mode and we want authenticated users to be able to improve the data. So I needed to explore alternatives.</p>
<p>I’ve been working with <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/services/nectar-research-cloud/how-to-access-the-ardc-nectar-research-cloud/">Nectar</a> over the past year to develop <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/using-nectar/">a GLAM Workbench application</a> that helps researchers do things like harvesting newspaper articles from a Trove search. So I thought I’d have a go at setting up Datasette in a Nectar instance, and it works! Here’s a few notes on what I did…</p>
<ul>
<li>First of course you need <a href="https://tutorials.rc.nectar.org.au/allocation-management/01-overview">get yourself a resource allocation</a> on Nectar. I’ve also got a persistent volume storage allocation that I’m using for the data.</li>
<li>From the Nectar Dashboard I made sure that I had an <a href="https://tutorials.rc.nectar.org.au/keypairs">SSH keypair configured</a>, and created a <a href="https://tutorials.rc.nectar.org.au/sec-groups-101">security group</a> to allow access via SSH, HTTP and HTTPS. I also <a href="https://tutorials.rc.nectar.org.au/volume-storage/01-overview">set up a new storage volume</a>.</li>
<li>I then <a href="https://tutorials.rc.nectar.org.au/launching-virtual-machines/01-overview">created a new Virtual Machine</a> using the Ubuntu 22.04 image, and attaching the keypair, security group, and volume storage. For the stock exchange data I’m currently used the ‘m3.medium’ flavour of virtual machine which provides 8gb of RAM and 4 VCPUs. This might be overkill, but I went with the bigger machine because of the size of the SQLite database (around 2gb). This is similar to what I used on Cloudstor after I ran into problems with the memory limit. I think most projects would run perfectly well using one of the ‘small’ flavours. In any case, it’s easy to resize if you run into problems.</li>
<li>Once the new machine was running I grabbed the IP address. Because I have DNS configured on my Nectar project, I also created a ‘datasette’ subdomain from the DNS dashboard by pointing an ‘A’ (alias) record to the IP address.</li>
<li>Using the IP address I <a href="https://tutorials.rc.nectar.org.au/connecting/02-terminal-and-ssh">logged into the new machine via SSH</a>.</li>
<li>With all the Nectar config done, it was time to set up Datasette. I mainly just followed the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/deploying.html">excellent instructions in the Datasette documention</a> for deploying Datasette using <code>systemd</code>. This involved installing <code>datasette</code> via <code>pip</code>, creating a folder for the Datasette data and configuration files, creating a <code>datasette.service</code> file for <code>systemd</code>.</li>
<li>I also used the <code>datasette install</code> command to add a couple of Datasette plugins. One of these is the <code>datasette-github-auth</code> plugin, which needs a couple of secret tokens set. I added these as environment variables in the <code>datasette.service</code> file.</li>
<li>The <code>systemd</code> setup uses Datasette’s <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/settings.html#configuration-directory-mode">configuration directory mode</a>. This means you can put your database, metadata definitions, custom templates and CSS, and any other settings all together in a single directory and Datasette will find and use them. I’d previously passed runtime settings via the command line, so I had to create a <code>settings.json</code> for these.</li>
<li>Then I just uploaded all my Datasette database and configuration files to the folder I created on the virtual machine using <code>rsync</code> and started the Datasette service. It worked!</li>
<li>The next step was to use the persistent volume storage for my Datasette files. The persistent storage exists independently of the virtual machine, so you don’t need to worry about losing data if there’s a change to the instance. I mounted the storage volume as <code>/pvol</code> in the virtual machine <a href="https://tutorials.rc.nectar.org.au/volume-storage/04-format-mount">as the Nectar documentation describes</a>.</li>
<li>I created a <code>datasette-root</code> folder under <code>pvol</code>, copied the Datasette files to it, and changed the <code>datasette.service</code> file to point to it. This didn’t seem to work and I’m not sure why. So instead I created a symbolic link between <code>/home/ubuntu/datasette-root</code> and <code>/pvol/datasette-root</code> and and set the path in the service file back to <code>/home/ubuntu/datasette-root</code>. This worked! So now the database and configuration files are sitting in the persistent storage volume.</li>
<li>To make the new Datasette instance visible to the outside world, I <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04">installed nginx</a>, and configured it as a Datasette proxy using the example in the Datasette documentation.</li>
<li>Finally I configured HTTPS <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">using certbot</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the steps above might seem complicated, it was mainly just a matter of copying and pasting commands from the existing documentation. The new Datasette instance is <a href="https://datasette.glamworkbench.cloud.edu.au">running here</a>, but this is just for testing and will disappear soon. If you’d like to know more about the Stock Exchange Project, check out the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/anu-archives/">ANU Archives</a> section of the GLAM Workbench.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m thinking about the Trove Researcher Platform discussions &amp; ways of integrating Trove with other apps and platforms (like the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/">GLAM Workbench</a>).</p>
<p>As a simple demo I modifed my <a href="https://trove-proxy.herokuapp.com/">Trove Proxy app</a> to convert a newspaper search url from the Trove web interface into an API query (using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/trove-query-parser/">trove-query-parser</a> package). The proxy app then redirects you to the <a href="https://troveconsole.herokuapp.com/">Trove API Console</a> so you can see the results of the API query without needing a key.</p>
<p>To make it easy to use, I created a bookmarklet that encodes your current url and feeds it to the proxy. To use it just:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag this link to your bookmarks toolbar: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Open Trove API Console<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</li>
<li>Run a search in Trove&rsquo;s newspapers.</li>
<li>Click on the bookmarklet.</li>
</ul>
<p>This little hack provides a bit of &lsquo;glue&rsquo; to help researchers think their about search results as data, and explore other possibilities for download and analysis. #dhhacks</p>

			 <p>The ARDC is collecting user requirements for the <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/strategic-activities/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/project-plans/trove-researcher-platform-for-advanced-research-project-plan/">Trove researcher platform for advanced research</a>. This is a chance to start from scratch, and think about the types of data, tools, or interface enhancements that would support innovative research in the humanities and social sciences. The ARDC will be holding <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/events/trove-researcher-platform-roundtables/">two public roundtables</a>, on 13 and 20 May, to gather ideas. I created a list of possible API improvements in my response to last year&rsquo;s draft plan, and thought it might be useful to expand that a bit, and add in a few other annoyances, possibilities, and long-held dreams.</p>
<p>My focus is again on the data; this is for two reasons. First because public access to consistent, good quality data makes all other things possible. But, of course, it&rsquo;s never just a matter of OPENING ALL THE DATA. There will be questions about priorities, about formats, about delivery, about normalisation and enrichment. Many of these questions will arise as people try to make use of the data. There needs to be an ongoing conversation between data providers, research tool makers, and research tool users. This is the second reason I think the data is critically important – our focus should be on developing communities and skills, not products. A series of one-off tools for researchers might be useful, but the benefits will wane. Building tools through networks of collaboration and information sharing based on good quality data offers much more. Researchers should be participants in these processes, not consumers.</p>
<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s my current wishlist&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="apis-and-data">APIs and data</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Bring the web interface and main public API back into sync, so that researchers can easily transfer queries between the two.</strong> The Trove interface update in 2020 reorganised resources into &lsquo;categories&rsquo;, replacing the original &lsquo;zones&rsquo;. The API, however, is still organised by zone and knows nothing about these new categories. Why does this matter? The web interface allows researchers to explore the collection and develop research questions. Some of these questions might be answered by downloading data from the API for analysis or visualisation. But, except for the newspapers, there is currently no one-to-one correspondence between searches in the web interface and searches using the API. There&rsquo;s no way of transferring your questions – you need to start again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Expand the metadata available for digitised resources other than newspapers.</strong> In recent years, the NLA has digitised huge quantities of books, journals, images, manuscripts, and maps. The digitisation process has generated new metadata describing these resources, but most of this is not available through the public API. We can get an idea of what&rsquo;s missing by comparing the digitised journals to the newspapers. The API includes <a href="https://troveconsole.herokuapp.com/#get-a-list-of-all-newspaper-titles">a <code>newspaper</code> endpoint</a> that provides data on all the newspapers in Trove. You can use it to get a list of available issues for any newspaper. There is no comparable way of retrieving a list of digitised journals, or the issues that have been digitised. The data’s somewhere – there&rsquo;s an internal API that’s used to generate lists of issues in the browse interface and I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/get-ocrd-text-from-digitised-journal/">scraped this to harvest issue details</a>. But this information should should be in the public API. Manuscripts are described using finding aids, themselves generated from EAD formatted XML files, but none of this important structured data is available from the API, or for download. There’s also <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-books/metadata-for-digital-works/">other resource metadata</a>, such as parent/child relationships between different levels in the object hierarchy (eg publication &gt; pages). These are embedded in web pages but not exposed in the API. The main point is that when it comes to data-driven research, <strong>digitised books, journals, manuscripts, images, and maps are second-class citizens</strong>, trailing far behind the newspapers in research possibilities. There needs to be a thorough stocktake of available metadata, and a plan to make this available in machine actionable form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Standardise the delivery of text, images, and PDFs and provide download links through the API.</strong> As noted above, digitised resources are treated differently depending on where they sit in Trove. There are no standard mechanisms for downloading the products of digitisation, such as OCRd text and images. OCRd text is available directly though the API for newspaper and journal articles, but to download text from a book or journal issue you need to hack the download mechanisms from the web interface. Links to these should be included in the API. Similarly, machine access to images requires various hacks and workarounds. There should be a consistent approach that allows researchers to compile image datasets from digitised resources using the API. Ideally IIIF standard APIs should be used for the delivery of images and maps. This would enable the use of the growing ecosystem of IIIF compliant tools for integration, analysis, and annotation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide an option to exclude search results in tags and comments.</strong> The Trove advanced search used to give you the option of excluding search results which only matched tags or comments, rather than the content of the resource. Back when I was working at Trove, the IT folks said this feature would be added to a future version of the API, but instead it disappeared from the web interface with the 2020 update! Why is this important? If you&rsquo;re trying to analyse the occurance of search terms within a collection, such as Trove&rsquo;s digitised newspapers, you want to be sure that the result reflects the actual content, and not a recent annotation by Trove users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Finally add the People &amp; Organisations data to the main API.</strong> Trove&rsquo;s People &amp; Organisations section was ahead of the game in providing machine-readable access, but the original API is out-of-date and uses a completely different query language. Some work was done on adding it to the main RESTful API, but it was never finished. With a bit of long-overdue attention, the People &amp; Organisations data could power new ways of using and linking biographical resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improve web archives CDX API.</strong> Although the NLA does little to inform researchers of the possibilities, the web archives software it uses (Pywb) includes some baked in options for retrieving machine-readable data. This includes <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/timegates-timemaps-mementos/">support for the Memento protocol</a>, and the provision of a CDX API that delivers basic metadata about individual web page captures. The current CDX API has some limitations ( <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/web-archives/blob/master/comparing_cdx_apis.ipynb">documented here</a> ). In particular, there&rsquo;s no pagination or results, and no support for domain-level queries. Addressing these limitations would make the existing CDX API much more useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide new data sources for web archives analysis.</strong> There needs to be an constructive, ongoing discussion about the types of data that could be extracted and shared from the Australian web archive. For example, a search API, or downloadable datasets of word frequencies. The scale is a challenge, but some pilot studies could help us all understand both the limits and the possibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide a Write API for annotations.</strong> Integration between components in the HASS RDC would be greatly enhanced if other projects could automatically add structured annotations to existing Trove resources. Indeed, this would create exciting possibilities for embedding Trove resources within systems of scholarly analysis, allowing insights gained through research to be automatically fed back into Trove to enhance discovery and understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide historical statistics on Trove resources.</strong> It&rsquo;s important for researchers to understand how Trove itself changes over time. There used to be a page that provided regularly-updated statistics on the number of resources and user annotations, but this was removed by the interface upgrade in 2020. I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://github.com/wragge/trove-newspaper-totals">started harvesting some basic stats</a> relating to Trove newspapers, but access to general statistics should be reinstated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reassess key authentication and account limits.</strong> DigitalNZ recently <a href="https://digitalnz.org/blog/posts/accessing-the-digitalnz-api">changed their policy around API authentication</a>, allowing public access without a key. Authentication requirements hinder exploration and limit opportunities for using the API in teaching and workshops. Similarly, I don&rsquo;t think the account usage limits have been changed since the API was released, even though the capacity of the systems has increased. It seems like time that both of these were reassessed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, I&rsquo;ll admit, that&rsquo;s a pretty long list, and not everything can be done immediately! I think this would be a good opportunity for the NLA to develop and share an API and Data Roadmap, that is regularly updated, and invites comments and suggestions. This would help researchers plan for future projects, and build a case for further government investment.</p>
<h2 id="integration">Integration</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Unbreak Zotero integration.</strong> The 2020 interface upgrade broke the existing Zotero integration and there&rsquo;s no straightforward way of fixing it without changes at the Trove end. Zotero used to be able to capture search results, metadata and images from most of the zones in Trove. Now it can only capture individual newspaper articles. This greatly limits the ability of researchers to assemble and manage their own research collections. More generally, a program to examine and support <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2022/01/29/zotero-support-in.html">Zotero integration across the GLAM sector</a> would be a useful way of spending some research infrastructure dollars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide useful page metadata</strong>. Zotero is just one example of a tool that can extract structured metadata from web pages. Such metadata supports reuse and integration, without the need for separate API requests. Only Trove&rsquo;s newspaper articles currently provide embedded metadata. Libraries used to lead the way is promoting the use of standardised, structured, embedded page metadata (Dublin Core anyone?), but now?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explore annotation frameworks.</strong> I&rsquo;ve mentioned the possibility of a Write API for annotations above, but there are other possibilities for supporting web scale annotations, such as <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/">Hypothesis</a>. Again, the current Trove interface makes the use of Hypothesis difficult, and again this sort of integration would be usefully assessed across the whole GLAM sector.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tools--interfaces">Tools &amp; interfaces</h2>
<p>Obviously any discussion of new tools or interfaces needs to start by looking at what&rsquo;s already available. This is difficult when the NLA won&rsquo;t even link to existing resources such as the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/">GLAM Workbench</a>. Sharing information about existing tools needs to be the starting point from which to plan investment in the Trove Researcher Platform. From there we can identify gaps and develop processes and collaborations to meet specific research needs. Here&rsquo;s a list of some <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2022/05/02/working-with-trove.html">Trove-related tools and resources</a> currently available through the GLAM Workbench.</p>
<h2 id="update-18-may-some-extra-bonus-bugs">Update (18 May): some extra bonus bugs</h2>
<p>I forgot to add these annoying bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>newspaper</code> endpoint returns both newspaper and gazette titles, even though there&rsquo;s a separate <code>gazette</code> endpoint. This forces you to do silly workarounds <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#get-a-list-of-trove-newspapers-that-doesnt-include-government-gazettes">like this in the GLAM Workbench</a>.</li>
<li>The <code>list</code> zone has recurring problems. At the moment it&rsquo;s impossible to <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#harvest-summary-data-from-trove-lists">harvest a complete set of Trove lists</a>.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>The ARDC is organising <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/events/trove-researcher-platform-roundtables/">a couple of public forums</a> to help gather researcher requirements for the <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/strategic-activities/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/project-plans/trove-researcher-platform-for-advanced-research-project-plan/">Trove component of the HASS RDC</a>. One of the roundtables will look at &lsquo;Existing tools that utilise Trove data and APIs&rsquo;. Last year I wrote a summary of what <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/08/26/glam-workbench-a.html">the GLAM Workbench can contribute to the development of humanities research infrastructure</a>, particularly in regard to Trove. I thought it might be useful to update that list to include recent additions to the GLAM Workbench, as well as a range of other datasets, software, tools, and interfaces that exist outside of the GLAM Workbench.</p>
<p>Since last year&rsquo;s post I&rsquo;ve also been working hard to integrate the GLAM Workbench with other eResearch services such as <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/using-nectar/">Nectar</a> and <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/glam-tools/">CloudStor</a>, and to document and support the ways that <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2022/03/02/the-glam-workbench.html">individuals and institutions can contribute</a> code and documentation.</p>
<h2 id="getting-and-moving-data">Getting and moving data</h2>
<p>There’s lots of fabulous data in Trove and other GLAM collections. In fact, there’s so much data that it can be difficult for researchers to find and collect what’s relevant to their interests. There are many tools in the GLAM Workbench to help researchers assemble their own datasets. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/">Get newspaper articles in bulk with the Trove Newspaper and Gazette Harvester</a></strong> – This has been around in some form for more than ten years (it pre-dates the Trove API!). Give it the url of a search in Trove’s newspapers and gazettes and the harvester will save all the metadata in a CSV file, and optionally download the complete articles as OCRd text, images, or PDFs. The amount of data you harvest is really only limited by your patience and disk space. I’ve harvested more than a million articles in the past. The GLAM Workbench includes a web app version of the harvester that runs live in the cloud – just paste in your Trove API key and the search url, and click the button.</li>
<li><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#harvest-information-about-newspaper-issues"><strong>Harvest information about newspaper issues</strong></a> – When you search Trove&rsquo;s newspapers, you find articles – these articles are grouped by page, and all the pages from a particular date make up an issue. But how do you find out what issues are available? On what dates were newspapers published? This notebook shows how you can get information about issues from the Trove API.</li>
<li><strong>Get Trove newspaper pages as images</strong> – If you need a nice, high-resolution version of a newspaper page you can <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#download-a-page-image">use this web app</a>. If you want to harvest every front page (or some other particular page) here’s an example that <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#harvest-australian-womens-weekly-covers-or-the-front-pages-of-any-newspaper">gets all the covers of the <em>Australian Women’s Weekly</em></a>. A pre-harvested <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#australian-womens-weekly-front-covers-1933-to-1982">collection of the AWW covers</a> is included as a bonus extra.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#save-a-trove-newspaper-article-as-an-image">Get Trove newspaper articles as images</a></strong> – The Trove web interface makes it difficult to download complete images of articles, but this tool will do the job. There’s a handy web app to grab individual images, but the code from this tool is reused in other places such as the Trove Newspaper Harvester and the Omeka uploader, and could be built-in to your own research workflows.</li>
<li><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#harvest-the-issues-of-a-newspaper-as-pdfs"><strong>Harvest the issues of a newspaper as PDFs</strong></a> – This notebook harvests <em>whole issues</em> of newspapers as PDFs – one PDF per issue.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#upload-trove-newspaper-articles-to-omeka-s">Upload Trove newspaper articles to Omeka</a></strong> – Whether you’re creating on online exhibition or building a research database, Omeka can be very useful. This notebook connects Trove’s newspapers to Omeka for easy upload. Your selected articles can come from a search query, a Trove list, a Zotero library, or just a list of article ids. Metadata records are created in Omeka for each article and newspaper, and an image of each article is attached. My <a href="https://wragge.github.io/omeka_s_tools/api.html">Omeka S Tools software package</a> also includes an example using Trove newspapers.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#get-ocrd-text-from-a-digitised-journal-in-trove">Get OCRd text from digitised periodicals in Trove</a></strong> – They’re often overshadowed by the newspapers, but there’s now lots of digitised journals, magazines, and parliamentary papers in Trove. You can get article-level data from the API, but not issue data. This notebook enables researchers to get metadata and OCRd text from every available issue of a periodical. To make researchers’ lives even easier, I regularly harvest <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#ocrd-text-from-trove-digitised-journals"><strong>all</strong> the available OCRd text</a> from digitised periodicals in Trove. The latest harvest downloaded 51,928 issues from 1,163 periodicals – that’s about 10gb of text. You can <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/trove-journals/blob/master/digital-journals-with-text.md">browse the list of periodicals</a> with OCRd text, or <a href="https://trove-digital-periodicals.glitch.me/data/trove-digital-journals">search this database</a>. All the OCRd text is stored in a public repository on CloudStor.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#get-covers-or-any-other-pages-from-a-digitised-journal-in-trove">Get page images from digitised periodicals in Trove</a></strong> – There’s more than text in digitised periodicals, and you might want to download images of pages for visual analysis. This notebook shows you how to get cover images, but could be easily modified to get another page, or a PDF. I used a modified version of this to create <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#editorial-cartoons-from-the-bulletin-1886-to-1952">a collection of 3,471 full page editorial cartoons</a> from <em>The Bulletin</em>, 1886 to 1952 – all available to download from CloudStor.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-books/#harvesting-the-text-of-digitised-books-and-ephemera">Get OCRd text from digitised books in Trove</a></strong> – Yep, there’s digitised books as well as newspapers and periodicals. You can download OCRd text from an individual book using the Trove web interface, but how do you make a collection of books without all that pointing and clicking? This notebook downloads all the available OCRd text from digitised books in Trove. The latest harvest includes <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-books/#ocrd-text-from-trove-books-and-ephemera">text from 26,762 works</a>. You can explore the results <a href="https://trove-digital-books.glitch.me/data/trove-digital-books">using this database</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#harvest-parliament-press-releases-from-trove">Harvest parliamentary press releases from Trove</a></strong> – Trove includes more than 380,000 press releases, speeches, and interview transcripts issued by Australian federal politicians and saved by the Parliamentary Library. This notebook shows you how to harvest both metadata and fulltext from a search of the parliamentary press releases. For example, here’s a collection of <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#politicians-talking-about-immigrants-and-refugees">politicians talking about ‘refugees’</a>, and another <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#politicians-talking-about-covid">relating to COVID-19</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-music/#harvest-abc-radio-national-records-from-trove">Harvest details of Radio National programs from Trove</a></strong> – Trove creates records for programs broadcast on ABC Radio National, for the major current affairs programs these records at at segment level. Even though they don’t provide full transcripts, this data provide a rich, fine-grained record of Australia’s recent political, social, and economic history. This notebook shows you how to download the Radio National data. If you just want to dive straight in, there’s also a <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-music/#abc-radio-national-programs">pre-harvested collection</a> containing more than 400,000 records, with separate downloads for some of the main programs.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#find-all-the-archived-versions-of-a-web-page">Find all the versions of an archived web page in Trove</a></strong> – Many of the tools in the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/">Web Archives section</a> of the GLAM Workbench will work with the Australian Web Archive, which is part of Trove. This notebook shows you how to get data about the number of times a web page has been archived over time.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#harvesting-collections-of-text-from-archived-web-pages">Harvesting collections of text from archived web pages in Trove</a></strong> – If you want to explore how the content of a web page changes over time, you can use this notebook to capture the text content of every archived version of a web page.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#convert-a-trove-list-into-a-csv-file">Convert a Trove list into a CSV file</a></strong> – While Trove provides a data download option for lists, it leaves out a lot of useful data. This notebook downloads full details of newspaper articles and other works in a list and saves them as CSV files. Like the Trove Newspaper Harvester, it lets you download OCRd text and images from newspaper articles.</li>
<li><strong>Collecting information about Trove user activity</strong> – It’s not just the content of Trove that provides interesting research data, it’s also the way people engage with it. Using the Trove API it’s possible to harvest details of <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/">all user created lists and tags</a>. And yes, there’s pre-harvested collections of <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#trove-lists-metadata">lists</a> and <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#trove-public-tags">tags</a> for the impatient.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I’m focusing here on Trove, there’s also tools to create datasets from the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/recordsearch/">National Archives of Australia</a>, <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/digitalnz/">Digital NZ and Papers Past</a>, the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/nma/">National Museum of Australia</a> and more. And there’s a <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/glam-data-list/">big list of readily downloadable datasets</a> from Australian GLAM organisations.</p>
<h2 id="visualisation-and-analysis">Visualisation and analysis</h2>
<p>Many of the notebooks listed above include examples that demonstrate ways of exploring and analysing your harvested data. There are also a number of companion notebooks that examine some possibilities in more detail, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/#exploring-your-troveharvester-data">Explore your Trove newspaper harvests</a></li>
<li><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/#display-the-results-of-a-harvest-as-a-searchable-database-using-datasette">Load your Trove newspaper harvest in Datasette</a></li>
<li><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-music/#exploring-abc-radio-national-metadata">Exploring ABC Radio National metadata</a></li>
<li><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#analyse-public-tags-added-to-trove">Analyse public tags added to Trove</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But there are also many other notebooks that demonstrate methods for analysing Trove’s content, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#querypic">QueryPic</a></strong> – Another tool that’s been around in different forms for a decade, QueryPic visualises searches in Trove’s newspapers. The latest web app couldn’t be simpler, just paste in your API key and a search url and create charts showing the number of matching articles over time. You can combine queries, change time scales, and download the data and visualisations. Interested to see how other researchers have used it? Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/08/30/some-research-projects.html">Twitter thread with links to some publications</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#visualise-trove-newspaper-searches-over-time">Visualise Trove newspaper searches over time</a></strong> – This is like a deconstructed version of QueryPic that walks you through the process of using Trove’s facets to assemble a dataset of results over time. It provide a lot of detail on the sorts of data available, and the questions we can ask of it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#visualise-the-total-number-of-newspaper-articles-in-trove-by-year-and-state">Visualise the total number of newspaper articles in Trove by year and state</a></strong> – This notebook uses a modified version of the code above to analyse the construction and context of Trove’s newspaper corpus itself. What are you actually searching? Meet the WWI effect and the copyright cliff of death! This is a great place to start if you want to get people thinking critically about digital resources are constructed.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/examples/trove_newspaper_issues_per_day.html">Trove newspapers – number of issues per day, 1803–2020</a></strong> – visualisation of the number of newspaper issues published <strong>every day</strong> in Trove.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#analyse-rates-of-ocr-correction">Analyse rates of OCR correction</a></strong> – Some more meta-analysis of the Trove corpus itself, this time focusing on patterns of OCR correction by Trove users.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#finding-non-english-newspapers-in-trove">Identifying non-English language newspapers in Trove</a></strong> – There are a growing number of non-English language newspapers digitised in Trove. However, if you&rsquo;re only searching using English keywords, you might never know that they&rsquo;re there. This notebook analyses a sample of articles from every newspaper in Trove to identify non-English content.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#beyond-the-copyright-cliff-of-death">Beyond the copyright cliff of death</a></strong> – Most of the newspaper articles on Trove were published before 1955, but there are some from the later period. This notebook helps you find out how many, and which newspapers they were published in.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#map-trove-newspaper-results-by-state">Map Trove newspaper results by state</a></strong> – This notebook uses the Trove <code>state</code> facet to create a choropleth map that visualises the number of search results per state.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#map-trove-newspaper-results-by-place-of-publication">Map Trove newspaper results by place of publication</a></strong> – This notebook uses the Trove <code>title</code> facet to find the number of results per newspaper, then merges the results with a dataset of geolocated newspapers to map where articles were published.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#compare-two-versions-of-an-archived-web-page">Compare two versions of an archived web page</a></strong> – This notebook demonstrates a number of different ways of comparing versions of archived web pages. Just choose a repository, enter a url, and select two dates to see comparisons based on: page metadata, basic statistics such as file size and number of words, numbers of internal and external links, cosine similarity of text, line by line differences in text or code, and screenshots.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#display-changes-in-the-text-of-an-archived-web-page-over-time">Display changes in the text of an archived web page over time</a></strong> – This web app gathers all the available versions of a web page and then visualises changes in its content between versions – what’s been added, removed, and changed?</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#using-screenshots-to-visualise-change-in-a-page-over-time">Use screenshots to visualise change in a page over time</a></strong>– Create a series of full page screenshots of a web page over time, then assemble them into a time series.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also possibilities for using Trove data creatively. For example you can <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#create-scissors-and-paste-messages-from-trove-newspaper-articles">create &lsquo;scissors and paste&rsquo; messages from Trove newspaper articles</a>.</p>
<h2 id="documentation-and-examples">Documentation and examples</h2>
<p>All the Trove notebooks in the GLAM Workbench help document the possibilities and limits of the Trove API. The examples above can be modified and reworked to suit different research interests. Some notebooks also explore particular aspects of the API, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove/">Trove API Introduction</a></strong> – Some very basic examples of making requests and understanding results.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#todays-news-yesterday">Today’s news yesterday</a></strong> – Uses the <code>date</code> index and the <code>firstpageseq</code> parameter to find articles from exactly 100 years ago that were published on the front page. It then selects one of the articles at random and downloads and displays an image of the front page.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-images/#the-use-of-standard-licences-and-rights-statements-in-trove-image-records">The use of standard licences and rights statements in Trove image records</a></strong> – Version 2.1 of the Trove API introduced a new rights index that you can use to limit your search results to records that include one of a list of standard licences and rights statements. We can also use this index to build a picture of which rights statements are currently being used, and by who.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-random/">Random items from Trove</a></strong> – Changes to the Trove API meant that techniques you could previously use to select resources at random no longer work. This section documents some alternative ways of retrieving random-ish works and newspaper articles from Trove.</li>
</ul>
<p>And while it’s not officially part of the GLAM Workbench, I also maintain the <a href="https://troveconsole.herokuapp.com/">Trove API Console</a> which provides lots of examples of the API in action.</p>
<h2 id="videos">Videos</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started making videos to help you get started with the GLAM Workbench.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a bit of cleaning up, trying to make some old datasets more easily available. In particular I&rsquo;ve been pulling together harvests of the number of newspaper articles in Trove by year and state. My <a href="https://timsherratt.org/shed/trove/graphs/">first harvests</a> date all the way back to 2011, before there was even a Trove API. Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t run the harvests as often as I should&rsquo;ve and there are some big gaps. Nonetheless, if you&rsquo;re interested in how Trove&rsquo;s newspaper corpus has grown and changed over time, you might find them useful. They&rsquo;re available in <a href="https://github.com/wragge/trove-newspaper-totals-historical">this repository</a> and also <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6471544">in Zenodo</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://updates.timsherratt.org/uploads/2022/2c1e7dd328.png" alt="Chart showing number of newspaper articles per year available in Trove – harvested multiple times from 2011 to 2022"></p>
<p><em>This chart shows how the number of newspaper articles per year in Trove has changed from 2011 to 2022. Note the rapid growth between 2011 and 2015.</em></p>
<p>To try and make sure that there&rsquo;s a more consistent record from now on, I&rsquo;ve also created a new Git Scraper – <a href="https://github.com/wragge/trove-newspaper-totals">a GitHub repository</a> that automatically harvests and saves data at weekly intervals. As well as the number of articles by <a href="https://github.com/wragge/trove-newspaper-totals/blob/master/data/total_articles_by_year.csv">year</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wragge/trove-newspaper-totals/blob/master/data/total_articles_by_year_and_state.csv">state</a>, it also harvests the number of articles by <a href="https://github.com/wragge/trove-newspaper-totals/blob/master/data/total_articles_by_newspaper.csv">newspaper</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wragge/trove-newspaper-totals/blob/master/data/total_articles_by_category.csv">category</a>. As mentioned, these four datasets are updated weekly. If you want to get all the changes over time, you can retrieve earlier versions from the repository&rsquo;s commit history.</p>
<p>All the datasets are CC-0 licensed and validated with Frictionless.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#visualise-the-total-number-of-newspaper-articles-in-trove-by-year-and-state">notebook in the GLAM Workbench</a> that explores this sort of data.</p>

			 <p>So my <a href="https://www.righttoknow.org.au/request/scoping_studies_on_hass_research">FOI request </a> to release the scoping studies that informed investments in the current round of ARDC-managed HASS research infrastructure development was partially successful. As I&rsquo;ve previously noted, reports from the ARDC and Academy of Humanities are now publicly available. There was a third document identified as relevant to my request that was finally released yesterday, but it isn&rsquo;t what I was expecting. It&rsquo;s a report of consultation relating to a discussion paper by Dandalo Partners, rather than the actual discussion paper itself! Clearly I spoke the wrong magic words, and should have asked for &lsquo;discussion papers&rsquo; as well as &lsquo;scoping studies&rsquo;. FOI can be a bit of a fishing expedition. I&rsquo;m considering whether I want to start the whole FOI process again by asking for the final version of the discussion paper, but in the meantime, I&rsquo;ve put the currently-available documents in a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/uq7vz4kdaf5hbxd/AAB2GBipm7tyhq8REsigOobfa?dl=0">Dropbox folder</a>.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Over the past few months I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of behind-the-scenes work on the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/">GLAM Workbench</a> – <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/12/01/digitalnz-te-papa.html">automating</a>, <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2022/01/28/testing-testing.html">standardising</a>, and documenting processes for developing and managing repositories. These sort of things ease the maintenance burden on me and help make the GLAM Workbench <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/about/#is-the-glam-workbench-sustainable">sustainable</a>, even as it continues to grow. But these changes are also aimed at making it easier for <strong>you</strong> to contribute to the GLAM Workbench!</p>
<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;re part of a GLAM organisation that wants to help researchers explore its collection data – why not create your own section of the GLAM Workbench? It would be a great opportunity for staff to develop their own digital skills and learn about the possibilities of Jupyter notebooks. I&rsquo;ve developed a <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/glam-workbench-template">repository template</a> and some <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/get-involved/developing-repositories/">detailed documentation</a> to get you started. The repository template includes everything you need to create and test notebooks, as well as built-in integration with Binder, Docker, Reclaim Cloud, and Zenodo. And, of course, I&rsquo;ll be around to help you through the process.</p>
<p><img src="https://updates.timsherratt.org/uploads/2022/a46891dbeb.png" alt="Screenshot of documentation"></p>
<p>Or perhaps you&rsquo;re a researcher who wants to <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/get-involved/contribute-code/">share some code you&rsquo;ve developed</a> that extends or improves an existing GLAM Workbench repository. Yes please!  Or maybe you&rsquo;re a GLAM Workbench user who has <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/get-involved/add-links/">something to add</a> to one of the lists of resources; or you&rsquo;ve noticed a problem with some of the documentation that <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/get-involved/editing-documentation/">you&rsquo;d like to fix</a>. All contributions welcome!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/get-involved/">Get involved!</a> page includes links to all this information, as well as some other possibilities such as becoming a <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/get-involved/supporters/">sponsor</a>, or sharing <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/categories/glamworkbench/">news</a>. And to recognise those who make a contribution to the code or documentation there&rsquo;s also a brand new <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/contributors/">contributors</a> page.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to exploring how we can build the GLAM Workbench together. #dhhacks</p>

			 <p>One of the things I really like about Jupyter is the fact that I can share notebooks in a variety of different formats. Tools like <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#querypic">QueryPic</a> can run as simple web apps using Voila, static versions of notebooks can be viewed using NBViewer, and live versions can be spun up as required on Binder. It’s also possible to export notebooks at PDFs, slideshows, or just plain-old HTML pages. Just recently I realised I could export notebooks to HTML using the same template I use for Voila. This gives me <em>another</em> way of sharing – static web pages delivered via the main <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/">GLAM Workbench</a> site.</p>
<p>Here’s a couple of examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/digitalnz-views/papers_past_newspapers.html">Papers Past newspapers in DigitalNZ</a> – showing which Papers Past newspapers are available through DigitalNZ</li>
<li><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/examples/trove_newspaper_issues_per_day.html">Trove newspapers – number of issues per day, 1803–2020</a> – the number of newspaper issues published <strong>every day</strong> in Trove</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://updates.timsherratt.org/uploads/2021/83610c54c6.png" alt="" title="Chart showing the number of newspaper issues in Trove published on each day in 1834."></p>
<p>Both are HTML pages that embed visualisations created using <a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/">Altair</a>. The visualisations are rendered using javascript, and even though the notebook isn’t running in a live computing environment, there’s some basic interactivity built-in – for example, you can hover for more details, and click on the DigitalNZ chart to search for articles from a newspaper. More to come! #dhhacks</p>

This means you can create your very own version of these repositories running in the Nectar Cloud, simply by choosing them from the app’s dropdown list. See the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/using-nectar/">Using Nectar</a> help page for more information.</p>
<p><img src="https://updates.timsherratt.org/uploads/2021/ad2303f5e6.png" alt="" title="Screenshot of Nectar app showing dropdown list"></p>
<p>I’ve also taken the opportunity to make use of the new container registry service developed by the ARDC as part of the <a href="https://arcos.ardc.edu.au/">ARCOS</a> project. The app now pulls the GLAM Workbench Docker images from <a href="https://quay.io/organization/glamworkbench">Quay.io</a> via the container registry’s cache. This means that copies of the images are cached locally, speeding things up and saving on data transfers. Yay for integration!</p>

			 <p>In preparation for my talk at <a href="https://resbaz.auckland.ac.nz/">ResBaz Aotearoa</a>, I updated the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/digitalnz/">DigitalNZ</a> and <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/tepapa/">Te Papa</a> sections of the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/">GLAM Workbench</a>. Most of the changes are related to management, maintenance, and integration of the repositories. Things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up GitHub actions to automatically generate Docker images when the repositories change, and to upload the images to the <a href="https://quay.io/organization/glamworkbench">Quay.io container registry</a></li>
<li>Automatic generation of an <code>index.ipynb</code> file based on <code>README.md</code> to act as a front page within Jupyter Lab</li>
<li>Addition of a <code>reclaim-manifest.jps</code> file to allow for one-click installation of the repository in <a href="https://reclaim.cloud/">Reclaim Cloud</a></li>
<li>Additional documentation in <code>README.md</code> with instructions on how to run the repository via <a href="https://mybinder.org/">Binder</a>, <a href="https://reclaim.cloud/">Reclaim Cloud</a>, <a href="https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/">Nectar Research Cloud</a>, and Docker Desktop.</li>
<li>Addition of a <code>.zenodo.json</code> metadata file so that new releases are preserved in Zenodo</li>
<li>Switch to using <code>pip-tools</code> for generating <code>requirements.txt</code> files, and the include unpinned requirements in <code>requirements.in</code></li>
<li>Update of all Python packages</li>
</ul>
<p>From the user’s point of view, the main benefit of these changes is the ability to run the repositories in a variety of different environments depending on your needs and skills. The Docker images, generated using <a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker">repo2Docker</a>, are used by Binder, Reclaim Cloud, Nectar, and Docker Desktop. Same image, multiple environments! See ‘Run these notebooks’ in the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/digitalnz/">DigitalNZ</a> and <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/tepapa/">Te Papa</a> sections of the GLAM Workbench for more information.</p>
<p><img src="https://updates.timsherratt.org/uploads/2021/d40a7d95cb.png" alt="" title="Screenshot of visualisation displaying information about Papers Past newspapers available through DigitalNZ."></p>
<p>Of course, I’ve also re-run all of the notebooks to make sure everything works and to update any statistics, visualisations, and datasets. As a bonus, there’s a couple of new notebooks in the DigitalNZ repository:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/digitalnz/#querypic-digitalnz">QueryPic DigitalNZ</a> – a web app to visualise searches in Papers Past over time (I’ll post some further info about this shortly)</li>
<li><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/digitalnz/#papers-past-newspapers-in-digitalnz">Papers Past newspapers in DigitalNZ</a> – displays details of the Papers Past newspapers available through DigitalNZ (you can <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/digitalnz-views/papers_past_newspapers.html">view the results</a> as an HTML page)</li>

			 <p>I’m hoping that the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/">GLAM Workbench</a> will encourage GLAM organisations and GLAM data nerds (like me) to create their own Jupyter notebooks. If they do, they can put a link to them in the list of <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/more-glam-notebooks/">GLAM Jupyter resources</a>. But what if they want to add the notebooks to the GLAM Workbench itself?</p>
<p>To make this easier, I’ve been working on <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/glam-workbench-template">a template repository for the GLAM Workbench</a>. It generates a new skeleton repository with all the files you need to develop and manage your own section of the GLAM Workbench. It uses GitHub’s built in templating feature, together with <a href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.2/">Cookiecutter</a> , and this <a href="https://github.com/stefanbuck/cookiecutter-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/setup-repository.yml">GitHub Action</a> by Stefan Buck. Stefan has also written a <a href="https://stefanbuck.com/blog/repository-templates-meets-github-actions">very helpful blog post</a>.</p>
<p>The new repository is configured to do various things automatically, such as generate and save Docker images, and integrate with Reclaim Cloud and Zenodo. Lurking inside the <code>dev</code> folder of each new repository, you’ll find <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/glam-workbench-template/tree/master/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.temp_directory%7D%7D/dev#readme">some basic details</a> on how to set up and manage your development environment.</p>
<p>This is just the first step. There’s more documentation to come, but you’re very welcome to try it out. And, of course, if you <em>are</em> interested in contributing to the development of the GLAM Workbench, let me know and I’ll help get you set up!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Previously on ‘What could we do with $2.3 million?’, the National Library of Australia produced a <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Research_Platform_TROVE.pdf">draft plan</a> for an ‘Advanced Researcher Platform’ that was <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/09/10/some-thoughts-on.html">thoroughly inadequate</a>. Rather than submit this plan to the <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/">ARDC</a> for consideration as part of the <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/strategic-activities/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/">HASS RDC process</a>, the NLA wisely decided to make some fundamental changes. The <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/strategic-activities/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/project-plans/trove-researcher-platform-for-advanced-research-project-plan/">redrafted draft</a> is now available for re-feedback. This is where we pick up the story…</p>
<h2 id="so-what-has-changed">So what has changed?</h2>
<p>Generally speaking there seem to be two major changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a much greater focus on consultation and collaboration.</li>
<li>There’s less detail about what will actually be developed.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two changes can work together positively. The details of what’s being developed can be worked out through consultation, ensuring that what’s developed meets real research needs. But this assumes first that the consultation process is effective, and second that the overall scope of the project is appropriate. I’m not convinced on either of these two fronts.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR – it’s better than it was, but the hand waving around collaboration and integration aren’t convincing, the scope needs rethinking, and I still can’t see how what’s proposed provides good value for money.</strong></p>
<h2 id="consultation">Consultation</h2>
<p>Given that there was almost no space for consultation in the previous draft, this version could only do better. There’s certainly lots of talk about consulting with the HASS community, and a new governance structure that includes researcher representatives, but what will the consultation process actually deliver?</p>
<p>The NLA is now partnering with the ANU (why the ANU? because it’s closest?), and the ANU will apparently be driving the consultation process. The whole process is complex and weirdly hierarchical. Any HASS researcher can participate in the initial rounds, but their numbers dwindle as you move up the hierarchy, until you reach the Project Board where only researchers with specific institutional affiliations are admitted. I’m imagining a Hunger Games scenario…</p>
<p>The process aims to gather feedback on ‘what developments would offer the best assistance to the majority and be feasibly achieved within the project timeframe’. That sounds ok, but earlier in the document the outcome of the consultation process is described in the following way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The outcome will be expressed as one (or potentially two) goals articulated in high level requirements document(s) and align to the objectives as described in this project plan. Indicative goals might include: a graph visualising occurrence of keywords over time; an interface visualising place of publication as geospatial data on a map; or, or a concordance for exploring textual data such as with key word in context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So all of this complex, hierarchical consultative structure is just to decide whether we have a line graph or a map (or both if we’re really lucky)? If you look at the project deliverables, it seems that the researcher feedback funnels into Deliverable 6 in Work Package 3 – ‘Analysing and visualising research data’. But what about the rest of the project? Will researcher feedback have any role in determining how datasets are created, for example?</p>
<p>I suppose even this very limited consultation is better than what was previously proposed (ie. nothing). But what then happens to the feedback from researchers? An Advisory Panel will be selected (by whom?) to collate the ideas and produce the high-level requirements. Detailed requirements will be generated from the high-level requirements (don’t you just love project management speak?), and then subjected to the argy bargy of the MoSCoW process where priorities will be set. It’s likely that these priorities will be whittled down further as development proceeds. These are crucial decision-making stages where important ideas can be relegated to the ‘nice to have’ category and never heard of again. It’s not clear from the plan who is involved in this, and where the final decision-making power lies.</p>
<p>Of course, some of these details can be worked out later. But given that the big sell of this version of the plan is the expanded consultative process, I think it’s important to know where the power really lies. What role will researchers actually play in determining the outcomes of the project? This is not at all clear.</p>
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>But what <em>is</em> the project? In general terms it hasn’t really changed. There will be some sort of portal where researchers can create and share datasets and visualisations. Crucially, it’s assumed that this portal will be part of Trove itself. As noted the last time round, the original project description provided by the government made no such assumption. It was focused on ’the delivery of researcher portals accessible through Trove’. The NLA has interpreted ‘through’ to mean ‘as part of’, and given the limits on the consultative process described above it seems this won’t change.</p>
<p>Or will it? I’m still puzzling over a few sections in the plan that talk about looking beyond the NLA to see whether there are existing options to meet user requirements. Deliverable 2 in Work Package 2 will:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Undertake an environmental scan for current research usage and tools such as (Glam Workbench) and a market scan to determine if these gaps can be filled by existing services that the HASS community and/or Trove support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What’s with the weird brackets around ‘Glam Workbench’? Makes me think it was a last minute addition. I suppose I should be grateful that the NLA wants to spend some money to confirm that the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/">GLAM Workbench</a> actually exists. But then what? The next deliverable will:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>determine which requirements will be delivered within the Trove Platform and which will be outsourced to other services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/">Trove Newspaper Harvester</a>, for example, meets one of the requirements, will Trove simply link to it? Imagine that, Trove actually linking to one of the dozens of Trove tools and resources provided by the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/">GLAM Workbench</a>. Oh frabjous day! But then does the NLA still get the money to develop the thing that I’ve already developed, or will they share some of the project money with me (yeah right)? I really have no idea what’s envisaged here. How will the ‘solution architecture’ integrate existing tools and services? And what does that mean for the resourcing of the project as a whole?</p>
<p>Elsewhere the plan talks about services ‘dedicated specifically to Trove collections and/or to the Australian research community’ that could be ‘“plugged in”’ to the platform ecosystem’. That sounds hopeful, but if the platform is an ecosystem of tools and services from the NLA and beyond, then that changes the scope of the project completely. Why not start with that? Start with the idea of developing an ecosystem of tools and services making use of Trove data, rather than just developing a new Trove interface. Then we could work together to build something really useful.</p>
<p>It just seems that the scope of the project as a whole hasn’t been properly thought through. The original plan has been expanded in vague, hand wavy directions, without thinking through the implications and possibilities of that expansion. Tinkering around the edges isn’t enough, the nature of this project needs to be completely rethought.</p>
<h2 id="wheres-the-strategy">Where’s the strategy?</h2>
<p>Rather than have an open call for project funding, the HASS RDC process has focused instead on making strategic investments. But where’s the strategy? The current projects were identified through a number of scoping studies undertaken by the Department of Education, Skills, and Employment. But these scoping studies haven’t been publicly released, so we don’t really know why these projects were recommended for funding. Is giving the NLA buckets of money to develop a new interface really what was envisaged? Surely if you were thinking strategically, you’d be considering ways in which the rich data asset represented by Trove could be opened to new research uses. You’d look around at existing tools and resources and think about how they could be leveraged. You’d examine limitations in the delivery of Trove data, and think about what sort of plumbing was needed to connect up new and existing projects. So how did we end up here?</p>
<p><strong>Perhaps we just need to take a step back and recognise that just because Trove provides the data, doesn’t mean it should direct the project.</strong> There needs to be another layer of strategic planning which identifies the necessary components and directs resources accordingly. As I <a href="https://gist.github.com/wragge/cf8eb2309f89b36d8d37402621d1a3b4">noted before</a>, there’s plenty of ways in which Trove’s data and APIs could be improved. Give them money to do that. But should they be building tools for researchers to use that data? Nope. Absolutely not.</p>
<p>I attended the eResearch Australasia Conference recently, and was really impressed with all the activity around research software development. If the tool building component of this project was opened up, it could provide a really useful focus for developing collaboration across the research software community and building capacities and understanding in HASS. It would also encourage greater reuse and integration. This would seems to be a much more strategic intervention.</p>
<h2 id="assorted-questions">Assorted questions</h2>
<p>I’m not going to go through the plan in detail again. I’ve already spent a couple of weeks engaged in, or worrying about, the HASS RDC process. I’m tired, and I’m frustrated, and I can’t shake the depressing thought that the NLA will end up being rewarded for its bad behaviour. Many of my <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/09/10/some-thoughts-on.html">comments on the earlier draft</a> still apply, particularly those around the API and the development of pathways for researchers.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting, however, that the ’sustainability’ section of the plan has disappeared completely – perhaps not surprisingly, as the only suggestion last time was for someone to give them more money. There are gestures towards integration, such as including representatives of the other HASS RDC projects on the Trove Project Board. But real integration would happen through technical interchange, not governance structures, and there’s no plan for that.</p>
<p>I’m also a bit confused about the role of ANU. It seems to be mostly focused on consultation, but then there are statements like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The development phase will be completed as a collaboration between the ANU and NLA, with both institutions working on the development of their own systems to align the with the product goals and Trove.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What ANU systems are we talking about here? And why are they part of the project?</p>
<p>A couple of objectives were also added to the plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘Explore opportunities to enrich the Trove corpus’ – sounds good, but it’s not picked up anywhere else in the plan, and has no deliverables associated with it. Is it just window dressing?</li>
<li>‘Develop Trove’s HASS community relationships and engagement capabilities’ – sorry if I’m cynical, but when your first plan doesn’t even bother to consult the HASS community, when you don’t even link to existing resources in the sector, why should we believe that this will now be an important, ongoing objective?</li>
</ul>
<p>On the issue of community relationships, a few people in the previous round of feedback indicated to me that they didn’t want to criticise the NLA too harshly because they might want to work with them in the future. That’s not healthy community building.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>After two attempts, the NLA has still not delivered a coherent project plan that demonstrates real value to the HASS sector and meets the ARDC’s assessment criteria. I think the project needs to be radically rethought, and leadership sought from outside the NLA to ensure that the available funding is used effectively.</p>
<p>I love Trove. I recognise the way it has transformed research, and was honoured to play a small part in its history. It should be appropriately funded. But it shouldn’t be funded to do everything.</p>
<p>In the end, we could do so much better, and so much more…</p>
<h2 id="have-your-say">Have your say…</h2>
<p>You can provide your own feedback on the new draft plan. There’ll be a <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/trove-researcher-platform-for-advanced-research-roundtable-discussions-tickets-201332971337">roundtable event on 10 November</a> when you can ask questions of the project participants. You can also submit your feedback by 17 November using the form at the bottom of <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/strategic-activities/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/project-plans/trove-researcher-platform-for-advanced-research-project-plan/">this page</a>. You might also want to remind yourself of the ARDC’s <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Evaluation-Criteria-HASS-RDC-and-Indigenous-Research-Capability-program.pdf">evaluation criteria</a>.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ll attend the roundtable, as this whole process has taken a bit of a toll, but I encourage you to do so. The more voices the better.</p>

			 <p>An inquiry on Twitter prompted me to put together <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#harvest-the-issues-of-a-newspaper-as-pdfs">a notebook</a> that you can use to <strong>download all available issues of a newspaper as PDFs</strong>. It was really just a matter of copying code from other tools and making a few modifications. The first step harvests a list of available issues for a particular newspaper from Trove. You can then download the PDFs of those issues, supplying an optional date range. Beware – this could consume a lot of disk space!</p>
<p>The PDF file names have the following structure:</p>
<pre><code>[newspaper identifier]-[issue date as YYYYMMDD]-[issue identifier].pdf
</code></pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>903-19320528-1791051.pdf
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>903</code> – the <a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/title/903">Glen Innes Examiner</a></li>
<li><code>19320528</code> – 28 May 1932</li>
<li><code>1791051</code> – to view in Trove just add this to <code>http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-issue</code>, eg <a href="http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-issue1791051">http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-issue1791051</a></li>

			 <p>The <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/">GLAM Workbench</a> isn’t dependent on one big piece of technological infrastructure. It’s basically a collection of Jupyter notebooks, and those notebooks can be used within a variety of different environments. This helps make the GLAM Workbench more sustainable – new components can be swapped in and out as required. It also makes it possible to create different pathways for users, depending on their digital skills, institutional support, and research needs. For example, links to <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/using-binder/">Binder</a> make it easy for users to explore the possibilities of the GLAM Workbench and accomplish quick tasks. But Binder has limits. Where do you go when your research project scales up?</p>
<p>Earlier this year I added one-click installation of GLAM Workbench repositories in <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/using-reclaim-cloud/">Reclaim Cloud</a>. <strong>Today I’m very pleased to announce that selected GLAM Workbench repositories can be installed as applications within the <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/services/nectar-research-cloud/">Nectar Research Cloud</a>.</strong> Using nationally-funded digital infrastructure, researchers in Australian universities can now create their own workbenches in minutes. So whether you’re harvesting truckloads of data from Trove or analysing web archives at scale, you can move beyond Binder and set up an environment dedicated to your research project. Cool huh?</p>
<p><img src="https://updates.timsherratt.org/uploads/2021/e10ef8218a.png" alt="You can install GLAM Workbench repositories using this simple application in Nectar!"></p>
<p>Currently four repositories can be installed on Nectar in this way:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/">Trove newspapers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/">Trove newspaper and gazette harvester</a></li>
<li><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/recordsearch/">Recordsearch</a> (National Archives of Australia)</li>
<li><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/">Web archives</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But more will be added in the future as I update repositories to generate the necessary Docker images. Nectar installation information is now included in each of these four repositories, and I’ve added a <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/using-nectar/">Using the Nectar Cloud</a> section to the help documentation that includes a detailed walkthrough of the installation process. If you strike any problems either <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/glam-workbench.github.io/issues">raise an issue</a> on GitHub, or ask a question at <a href="https://ozglam.chat/c/glam-workbench/8">OzGLAM Chat</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Huge thanks to Andy, Jacob, and Jo</strong> at the <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/">Australian Research Data Commons</a> (ARDC) who responded enthusiastically to my tweeted query, and packaged the repositories up into an easy-to-install, <a href="https://github.com/NeCTAR-RC/murano-glamworkbench">reusable application</a>. After all the work I’ve put into the GLAM Workbench, it’s really exciting to see it embedded within Australia’s digital research infrastructure. #dhhacks</p>

			 <p>A new version of the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/name-search/">GLAM Name Index Search</a> is available. An additional 49 indexes have been added, bringing the total to 246. You can now search for names in more than <strong>10.2 million records</strong> from 9 organisations.</p>
<p>The new indexes come from Queensland State Archives and the State Library of WA. QSA <a href="https://twitter.com/QSArchives/status/1448891637116067840">announced on Friday</a> that they’d added two new indexes to their site. When I went to harvest them, I realised there was another 25 indexes that I hadn’t previously picked up. It seems that some QSA datasets are tagged as ‘Queensland State Archives’ in the data.qld.gov.au portal, but others are tagged as ‘queensland state archives’ – and the tag search is case sensitive! I now search for both the upper and lower case tags.</p>
<p>There’s also a number of additions from the State Library of WA. These datasets were already in my harvest, but because of some oddities in their formatting, I hadn’t included them in the Index Search. Looking at them again, I realised they were right to go, so I’ve added them in.</p>

			 <p>When you search Trove&rsquo;s newspapers, you find articles – these articles are grouped by page, and all the pages from a particular date make up an issue. But how do you find out what issues are available? How do you get a list of dates when newspapers were published? This <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#harvest-information-about-newspaper-issues">notebook in the GLAM Workbench</a> shows how you can get information about issues from the Trove API.</p>
<p>Using the notebook, I’ve created a couple of datasets ready for download and use.</p>

			 <p>Way back in 2013, I went to the eResearch Australasia conference as the manager of Trove to talk about <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/wragge/beyond-discovery">new research possibilities using the Trove API</a>. Eight years years later <a href="https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/events/a-glam-workbench-for-humanities-researchers/">I was back</a>, still spruiking the possibilities of Trove data. This time, however, I was discussing Trove in the broader context of <strong>GLAM</strong> data – all the exciting possibilities that have emerged as galleries, libraries, archives and museums make more of their collections available in machine-readable form. The <strong>big question</strong> is, of course, how do researchers, particularly those in the humanities, make use of that data? The <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/">GLAM Workbench</a> is my attempt to address that question – to provide humanities researchers with both the tools and information they need, and an understanding of the possibilities that might emerge if they invest a bit of time in working with GLAM data. My eResearch Australasia 2021 presentation provides a quick introduction to the GLAM Workbench, here’s the <a href="https://vimeo.com/631475562">video</a>, and the <a href="https://slides.com/wragge/eresearch2021">slides</a>.</p>

<p>The presentation was pre-recorded, but I managed to sneak in an update via chat for those who attended the session. More news on this next week… 🥳</p>

			 <p>Late last year the Federal Government <a href="https://ministers.dese.gov.au/tehan/improving-hass-and-indigenous-research-infrastructure">announced</a> it was making an $8.9 million investment in HASS and Indigenous research infrastructure. This program is being managed by the ARDC and will lead to the development of a <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/strategic-activities/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/">HASS Research Data Commons</a>. According to the ARDC, a research data commons:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>brings together people, skills, data, and related resources such as storage, compute, software, and models to enable researchers to conduct world class data-intensive research</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds awesome!</p>
<p>Based on scoping studies commissioned by the Department of Education, Skills, and Employment (which have not yet been made public), <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/strategic-activities/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/recommendations-for-co-investment-in-humanities-arts-and-social-sciences-research-data-commons-program/">four activities were selected for initial funding</a> under this program. Draft project plans for these four activities have now been <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/strategic-activities/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/project-plans/">released for public comment</a>.</p>
<p>One of these activities aims to develop a ’Trove researcher platform for advanced research’:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Augmenting existing National Library of Australia resources, this platform will enable a focus on the delivery of researcher portals accessible through Trove, Australia’s unique public heritage site. The platform will create tools for visualisation, entity recognition, transcription and geocoding across Trove content and other corpora.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Research_Platform_TROVE.pdf">download the draft project plan</a> for the Trove platform. Funding for this activity will be capped at $2,301,185 across 2021-23. In this post I’ll try to pull together some of my own thoughts on this plan.</p>
<p>I suppose I’d better start with a disclaimer – I’m not a neutral observer in this. I started scraping data from Trove newspapers way back in 2010, building the first versions of tools like QueryPic and the Trove Newspaper Harvester. While I was manager of Trove, from 2013 to 2016, I argued for recognition of Trove as a key part of Australia’s humanities research infrastructure, and highlighted possible research uses of Trove data available through the API. Since then I’ve worked to bring a range of digital tools, examples, tutorials, and hacks together for researchers in the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/">GLAM Workbench</a> – a <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/08/26/glam-workbench-a.html">large number of these</a> work with data from Trove.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that Trove should receive ongoing funding through <a href="https://www.dese.gov.au/ncris">NCRIS</a> as a piece of national research infrastructure. Unfortunately though, the draft project plan does not make a strong case for investment – it’s vague, unimaginative, and makes little attempt to integrate with existing tools and services. I think it scores poorly against the ARDC’s <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Evaluation-Criteria-HASS-RDC-and-Indigenous-Research-Capability-program.pdf">evaluation criteria</a>, and doesn’t seem to offer good value for money. As someone who has championed the use of Trove data for research across the last decade, I’m very disappointed.</p>
<h2 id="whats-planned">What’s planned?</h2>
<p>So what is being proposed? There seems to be three main components:</p>
<ol>
<li>Authenticated ‘project’ spaces for researchers where datasets relating to a particular research topic can be stored</li>
<li>The ability to create custom datasets from a search in Trove</li>
<li>Tools to visualise stored datasets.</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s no doubt that these are all useful functions for researchers, but many problems arise when we look at how they’re going to be implemented.</p>
<h3 id="1-authenticated-project-spaces">1. Authenticated project spaces</h3>
<p>The draft plan indicates that authentication of users through the <a href="https://aaf.edu.au/">Australian Access Federation</a> is preferred. Why? Trove already has a system for the creation of user accounts. Using AAF would limit use of the new platform to those attached to universities or research agencies. I don’t understand what the use of AAF adds to the project, except perhaps to provide an example of integration with existing infrastructure services.</p>
<p>The plan notes that project spaces could be ‘public’ or ‘private’. Presumably a ‘public’ space would give access to stored datasets, but what sort of access controls would be available in relation to individual datasets? It’s also noted (Deliverable 7) that researchers would have ‘an option to “publish” their research findings for public consumption‘. Does this mean datasets and visualisations would be assigned a DOI (or other persistent identifier) and preserved indefinitely? How might these spaces integrate with existing data repositories?</p>
<h3 id="2-create-custom-datasets">2. Create custom datasets</h3>
<p>The lack of detail in the plan makes it difficult to assess what’s being proposed here. But it seems that users would be able to construct a search using the Trove web interface (or a new search interface?) and save the results as a dataset.</p>
<p>What data would be searched? It’s not clear, but in reference to the visualisations it’s stated that data would come from ’Trove’s existing full text collections (newspapers and gazettes, magazines and newsletters, books)’. So no web archives, and no metadata from any of Trove’s aggregated collections (even without full text, collection metadata can create interesting research possibilities, see for example the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-music/">Radio National records</a> in the GLAM Workbench).</p>
<p>What will be included in each dataset? There’s few details, but at a minimum you’d expect something like a CSV containing the metadata of all the matching records, and files containing the full text content of the items. These could potentially be <em>very</em> large. There’s no indication about how storage and processing demands would be managed, but presumably there would be some per user, or per project, limits.</p>
<p>Deliverable 8, ‘Data and visual download’, states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All query results must be available as downloadable files, this would include CSV, JSON and XML for the query results list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there’s no mention of the full text content at all. Will it be included in downloadable datasets?</p>
<p>As well as the record metadata and full text, you’d want there to be some metadata captured about the dataset itself – the search query used, when it was captured, the number of records, etc. To support integration and reuse, it would be good to align this with something like <a href="https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/">RO Crate</a>.</p>
<p>How will searches be constructed? It’s not clear if this will be integrated with the existing search interface, or be something completely separate; however, the plan does note that ‘limitations are put onto the dataset like keyword search terms and filters corresponding to the filters currently available in the interface’. So it seems that the new platform will be using the existing search indexes. It’s obviously important for the relationship between existing search functions and the new dataset creation tool to be explicit and transparent so that researchers understand what they’re getting.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that changes to the search interface last year removed some useful options from the advanced search form. In particular, you can no longer exclude matches in tags or comments. If you’re a researcher looking for the occurrence of a particular word, you generally don’t want to include records where that word only appears in a user added tag (I have a story about ‘Word War I’ that illustrates this!).</p>
<p>This raises a broader issue. There doesn’t seem to be any mention in the project plan of work to improve the metadata and indexing in response to research needs. Even just identifying digitised books in the current web interface can be a bit of a challenge, and digitised books and periodicals can be grouped into work records with other versions. We need to recognise that the needs of discovery sometimes compromise specific research uses.</p>
<p>I’m trying to be constructive in my responses here, but at this point I just have to scream – WHAT ABOUT THE <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/">TROVE NEWSPAPER HARVESTER</a>? A tool has existed for <em>ten years</em> that lets users create a dataset containing metadata and full text from a search in Trove’s newspapers and gazettes. I’ve spent a lot of time over recent years adding features and making it easier to use. Now you can download not only full text, but also PDFs and images of articles. The latest web app version in the GLAM Workbench runs in the cloud. Just one click to start it up, then all you need to do is paste in your Trove API key and the url of your search. It can’t get much easier.</p>
<p>The GLAM Workbench also includes tools to create datasets and download OCRd text from Trove’s <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-books/">books</a> and digitised <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/">journals</a>. These are still in notebook form, so are not as easy to use, but I have created pre-harvested datasets of all books and periodicals with OCRd text, and stored them on CloudStor. What’s missing at the moment is something to harvest a collection of journal articles, but this would not be difficult. As an added bonus, the GLAM Workbench has tools to <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#harvesting-collections-of-text-from-archived-web-pages">create full text datasets</a> from the Australian Web Archive.</p>
<p>So what is this project really adding? And why is there no attempt to leverage existing tools and resources?</p>
<h3 id="3-visualise-datasets">3. Visualise datasets</h3>
<p>Again, there’s a fair bit of hand waving in the plan, but it seems that users will be able to select a stored dataset and then choose a form of visualisation. The plan says that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An initial pilot would allow users to create line graphs that plot the frequency of a search term over time and maps that display results based on state-level geolocation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Up to three additional visualisations would be created later based on research feedback. It’s not clear which researchers will be consulted and when their feedback will be sought.</p>
<p>The value of these sorts of visualisations is obviously dependent on the quality and consistency of the metadata. There’s nothing built into this plan that would, for example, allow a researcher to clean or normalise any of the saved data. You have to take what you’re given. The newspaper metadata is generally consistent, but books and periodicals less so.</p>
<p>It’s also important to clarify what’s meant by ‘the frequency of a search term over time’. Does this mean the number of records matching a search term, or the number of times that the search term actually appears in the full text of all matched records? If the latter, then this <em>would</em> be a major enrichment of the available data. Though if this data was available it should be pushed through the API and/or made available as a downloadable dataset for integration with other platforms (perhaps along the lines of the Hathi Trust’s <a href="https://analytics.hathitrust.org/datasets">Extracted Features Dataset</a>). I suspect, however, that what is actually meant is the number of matching search results.</p>
<p>Again, the value of any geospatial visualisation depends on what is actually being visualised! The <code>state</code> facet in newspapers indicates place of publication, it’s not clear what the <code>place</code> facet in other categories represents. For this sort of visualisation to be useful in a research context, there would need to be some explanation of how these values were created, and any gaps or uncertainties.</p>
<p>Time for another scream of frustration — WHAT ABOUT <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#querypic">QUERYPIC</a>? Another long-standing tool which has already been <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/08/30/some-research-projects.html">cited a number of times</a> in research literature. <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#querypic">QueryPic</a> visualises searches in Trove’s newspapers and gazettes over time. You can adjust time scales and intervals, and download the results as images, a CSV file, and an HTML page. The project plan makes a point of claiming that its tools would not require any coding, but neither does QueryPic. Just plug in an API key and a search URL. I even made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAclcciEeCD2z2BWQ2r3xD_Q8c05HppfP">some videos</a> about it! The GLAM Workbench also includes a number of examples of how you can <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#map-trove-newspaper-results-by-state">visualise places of publication</a> of newspaper articles.</p>
<p>But it’s not just the GLAM Workbench. The <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Language_Commons_Australia.pdf">Linguistics Data Commons of Australia</a>, another activity to be funded as part of the HASS Research Data Commons, will include tools for text analysis and visualisation. The <a href="https://www.tlcmap.org/">Time Layered Cultural Map</a> is developing tools for geospatial visualisation of Australian collections. Surely the focus should be on connecting and reusing what’s available. Again I’m wondering what this project is really adding.</p>
<h2 id="portals-and-platforms">Portals and platforms</h2>
<p>The original language describing the funded activity is interesting — it is intended to ‘focus on the delivery of researcher portals accessible through Trove’.</p>
<p><strong><em>Portals</em> (plural) accessible <em>through</em> (not in) Trove.</strong></p>
<p>The NLA could meet a fair proportion of its stated objectives right now, simply by including links to QueryPic and the Trove Newspaper and Gazette Harvester. Done! There’s a million dollars saved.</p>
<p>More seriously, there’s no reason why the outcome of this activity should be a new interface attached to Trove and managed by the NLA. Indeed, such an approach works against integration, reuse, and data sharing. I believe the basic assumptions of the draft plan are seriously flawed. We need to separate out the strands of what’s meant by a ‘platform for advanced research’, and think more creatively and collaboratively about how we could achieve something useful, flexible, and sustainable.</p>
<h2 id="wheres-the-api">Where’s the API?</h2>
<p>I think the primary role of the NLA in the development of this research platform should be as the data provider. There are numerous ways in which Trove’s data might be improved and enriched in support of new research uses. These improvements could then be pushed through the API to integrate with a range of tools and resources. Which raises the question — where is the API in this plan?</p>
<p>The only mention of the API comes as an option for a user with ‘high technical expertise’ to extend the analysis provided by the built-in visualisations. This is all backwards. The API is the key pipeline for data-sharing and integration and should be at the heart of this plan.</p>
<p>This program offers an opportunity to make some much-needed improvements to the API. Here’s a few possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring the web interface and API back into sync so that researchers can easily transfer queries between the two (Trove’s interface update introduced new categories, while the API still groups resources by the original zones).</li>
<li>Provide public API access to additional data about digitised items. For example, you can get lists of newspaper titles and issues from the API, but there’s no comparable method to get titles and issues for digitised periodicals. The data’s there – it’s used to generate lists of issues in the browse interface – but it’s not in the API. There’s also other resource metadata, such as parent/child relationships, which are embedded in web pages but not exposed in the API.</li>
<li>Standardise the delivery of OCRd text for different resource types.</li>
<li>Finally add the People &amp; Organisations data to the main RESTful API.</li>
<li>Fix the limitations of the web archives CDX API (<a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/web-archives/blob/master/comparing_cdx_apis.ipynb">documented here</a>).</li>
<li>Add a search API for the web archives.</li>
<li>And what about a Write API? Integration between components in the HASS RDC would be greatly enhanced if other projects could automatically add structured annotations to existing Trove resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the HASS RDC would benefit greatly by thinking much more about the role of the Trove API in establishing reusable data flows, and connecting up components.</p>
<h2 id="pathways">Pathways</h2>
<p>Anyone who’s been to one of my <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/presentations/">GLAM Workbench talks</a> will know that I talk a lot about ‘pathways’. My concern is not just to provide useful tools and examples, but to try and connect them in ways that encourage researchers to develop their skills and confidence. So a researcher with limited digital skills can spin up QueryPic and start making visualisations without any specialised knowledge. But if they want to explore the data and assumptions behind QueryPic, they can view a notebook that walks them through the process of getting data from facets and assembling a time series. If they find something interesting in QueryPic, they can go to the Newspaper Harvester and assemble a dataset that helps them zoom into a particular period. There are places to go.</p>
<p>Similarly, users can start making use of the GLAM Workbench in the cloud using <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/using-binder/">Binder</a> – one click and it’s running. But as their research develops they might find Binder a bit limiting, so there are options to spin up the GLAM Workbench using <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/using-reclaim-cloud/">Reclaim Cloud</a> or <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/using-docker/">Docker</a>. As a researcher’s skills, needs, and questions change, so does their use of the GLAM Workbench. At least that’s the plan – I’m very aware that there’s much, much more to do to build and document these pathways.</p>
<p>The developments described in the draft plan are focused on providing simple tools for non-technical users. That’s fair enough, but you have to give those users somewhere to go, some path beyond, or else it just becomes another dead end. Users can download their data or visualisation, but then what?</p>
<p>Of course you don’t point a non-coder to API documentation and say ‘there you go’. But coders can use the API to build and share a range of tools that introduce people to the possibilities of data, and scaffold their learning. Why should there be just one interface? It’s not too difficult to imagine a range of introductory visualisation tools aimed at different humanities disciplines. Instead of focusing inward on a single Trove Viz Lite tool, why not look outwards at ways of embedding Trove data within a range of research training contexts?</p>
<h2 id="integration">Integration</h2>
<p>A number of the HASS RDC Evaluation Criteria focus on issues of integration, collaboration, and reuse of existing resources. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Project plans should display robust proposal planning including the maximisation of the use or re-use of existing research infrastructure, platforms, tools, services, data storage and compute.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Project plans should display integrated infrastructure layers with other HASS RDC activities, in particular by linking together elements such as data storage, tools, authentication, licensing, networks, cloud and high-performance computing, and access to data resources for reuse.</li>
<li>Project plans must be robust and contribute to the HASS RDC as a coherent whole that capitalises on existing data collections, adheres to the F.A.I.R. principles, develops collaborative tools, utilises shared underlying infrastructure and has appropriate governance planning.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s little evidence of this sort of thinking in the draft project plan. I’ve mentioned a few obvious opportunities for integration above, but there are many more. Overall, I think the proposed ‘platform for advanced research’ needs to be designed as a series of interconnected components, and not be seen as the product of a single institution.</p>
<p>We could imagine, for example, a system where the NLA focused on the delivery of research-ready data via the Trove API. A layer of data filtering, cleaning, and packaging tools could be built on top of the API to help users assemble actionable datasets. The packaging processes could use standards such as RO-Crate to prepare datasets for ingest into data repositories. Existing storage services, such as CloudStor, could be used for saving and sharing working datasets. Another layer of visualisation and analysis tools could either process these datasets, or integrate directly with the API. These tools could be spread across different projects including LDaCA, TLCMap, and the GLAM Workbench — using standards such as Jupyter to encourage sharing and reuse of individual components, and running on a variety of cloud-hosted platforms. Instead of just adding another component to Trove, we’d be building a collaborative network of tool builders and data wranglers — developing capacities across the research sector, and spreading the burden of maintenance.</p>
<h2 id="sustainability">Sustainability</h2>
<p>The draft project plan includes some pretty worrying comments about long-term support for the new platform. Work Package 5 notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The developed product will require support post release which can be guaranteed for a period not exceeding the contracted period for this project</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ARDC will be responsible for providing ongoing financial support for this phase. It has not been included in the proposal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So once the project is over, the NLA will not support the new platform unless the ARDC provides ongoing funding. What researcher would want to ‘publish’ their data on a platform that could disappear at any time? We all know that sustainability is hard, but you would think that the NLA could at least offer to work collaboratively with the research sector to develop a plan for sustainability, instead of just asking for more money. Why would anyone invest so much for so little?</p>
<h2 id="leadership-and-community">Leadership and community</h2>
<p>The development of collaborations and communities also figure prominently in the HASS RDC Evaluation Criteria. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Project plans should clearly demonstrate that they enable collaboration and build communities across geographically dispersed research groups through facilitated sharing of high-quality data, particularly for computational analysis; the development of new platforms for collaboration and sharing; and, the encouragement of innovative methodologies through the use of analytic tools.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Project plans must include a demonstrated commitment to ongoing community development to ensure the sustainability of the development is vital. The deliverables will act as ongoing national research infrastructure. They must be broadly usable by more than just the project partners and serve as input to a wide range of research.</li>
<li>Project plans, and project leads in particular, should demonstrate the research leadership that will foster and encourage the uptake and use of the HASS RDC.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again the draft project plan falls short. There are no project partners listed. Instead the plan refers broadly to all of Trove’s content partners, none of whom have direct involvement in this project. Indeed, as noted above, data aggregated from project parters is excluded from the new platform.</p>
<p>There are no new governance arrangements proposed for this project. Instead the plan refers to the Trove Strategic Advisory Committee which includes representatives from partner organisations. But there are no researcher representatives on this committee.</p>
<p>The only consultation with the research sector undertaken in the ‘Consultation Phase’ of the project is that undertaken by the ARDC itself. Does that mean this current process whereby the ARDC is soliciting feedback on the project plans? Whoa, meta…</p>
<p>The plan notes that during the testing phase described in Work Package 3, ‘HASS community members would gain access to a beta version of the product for comment’. However, later it is stated that access would be provided to ’a subset of researchers’, and that only system bugs and ‘high priority improvements’ would be acted upon.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, it seems that the NLA is seeking as little consultation as possible. It’s not exploring options for collaboration. It’s not engaging with the research community about these developments. That doesn’t seem like an effective way to build communities. Nor does it demonstrate leadership.</p>
<h2 id="summing-up">Summing up</h2>
<p>This project plan can’t be accepted in its current form. We’ve had failures and disappointments in the development of HASS research infrastructure in the past. The HASS RDC program gives us a chance to start afresh, and the focus on integration, data-sharing, and reuse give hope that we can build something that will continue to grow and develop, and not wither through lack of engagement and support. So should the NLA be getting $2 million to add a new component to Trove that is not integrated with other HASS RDC projects, and substantially duplicates tools available elsewhere? No, I don’t think so. They need to go back to the drawing board, undertake some real consultation, and build collaborations, not products.</p>

			 <p>Over the last few weeks I’ve been updating my harvests of OCRd text from digitised <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/08/16/explore-troves-digitised.html">books</a> and <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/08/06/updated-lots-and.html">periodicals</a> in Trove. As part of the harvesting process, I’ve created lists of both that are available in digital form – this includes digitised works, as well as those that are born-digital (such as PDFs or epubs). I’ve published the full lists of <a href="https://trove-digital-books.glitch.me/data/trove-digital-books">books</a> and <a href="https://trove-digital-periodicals.glitch.me/data/trove-digital-journals">periodicals</a> as searchable databases to make them easy to explore.</p>
<p><img src="https://updates.timsherratt.org/uploads/2021/51c3edce9a.png" alt="" title="Screenshot of database of Trove's government publications."></p>
<p>One thing that you might notice is that works with the format ‘Government publication’ pop up in both lists – sometimes it’s not clear whether something is a ‘book’ or ‘periodical’. To make it easier to find these items, no matter what their format, I’ve combined data from my two harvests and created a <a href="https://trove-government-publications.glitch.me/data/trove-government-publications">searchable dataset of government publications</a>. It includes links to download OCRd text from CloudStor if available.</p>
<p>All three databases make use of Datasette, which I’ve also used for the <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/08/23/a-family-history.html">GLAM Name Index Search</a>. One of the cool things about <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> is that it provides it’s own API, so if you find some interesting in any of these databases, you can easily download the machine-readable data for further analysis. #dhhacks</p>

			 <p>We’re in the midst of planning for the <a href="https://ardc.edu.au/collaborations/strategic-activities/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/">HASS Research Data Commons</a>, which will deliver some much-needed investment in digital research infrastructure for the humanities and social sciences. Amongst the funded programs are tools for text analysis as part of the Linguistics Data Commons, and a platform for more advanced research using Trove. I’m hoping that this will be an opportunity to take stock of existing tools and resources, and build flexible pathways for researchers that enable them to collect, move, analyse, preserve, and share data across different platforms and services.</p>
<p>To this end, I thought it might be useful to try and summarise what the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/">GLAM Workbench</a> offers, particularly for <a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/">Trove</a> researchers. The GLAM Workbench doesn’t really have an institutional home, and is mostly unfunded – it’s my passion project. That means that it’s easy to overlook, particularly when the big grants are being doled out. But I think it has a lot to offer and I’m looking forward to exploring ways it can connect with these new initiatives.</p>
<h2 id="getting-and-moving-data">Getting and moving data</h2>
<p>There’s lots of fabulous data in Trove and other GLAM collections. In fact, there’s so much data that it can be difficult for researchers to find and collect what’s relevant to their interests. There are many tools in the GLAM Workbench to help researchers assemble their own datasets. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/">Get newspaper articles in bulk with the Trove Newspaper and Gazette Harvester</a></strong> – This has been around in some form for more than ten years (it pre-dates the Trove API!). Give it the url of a search in Trove’s newspapers and gazettes and the harvester will save all the metadata in a CSV file, and optionally download the complete articles as OCRd text, images, or PDFs. The amount of data you harvest is really only limited by your patience and disk space. I’ve harvested more than a million articles in the past. The GLAM Workbench includes a web app version of the harvester that runs live in the cloud – just paste in your Trove API key and the search url, and click the button.</li>
<li><strong>Get Trove newspaper pages as images</strong> – If you need a nice, high-resolution version of a newspaper page you can <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#download-a-page-image">use this web app</a>. If you want to harvest every front page (or some other particular page) here’s an example that <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#harvest-australian-womens-weekly-covers-or-the-front-pages-of-any-newspaper">gets all the covers of the <em>Australian Women’s Weekly</em></a>. A pre-harvested <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#australian-womens-weekly-front-covers-1933-to-1982">collection of the AWW covers</a> is included as a bonus extra.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#save-a-trove-newspaper-article-as-an-image">Get Trove newspaper articles as images</a></strong> – The Trove web interface makes it difficult to download complete images of articles, but this tool will do the job. There’s a handy web app to grab individual images, but the code from this tool is reused in other places such as the Trove Newspaper Harvester and the Omeka uploader, and could be built-in to your own research workflows.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#upload-trove-newspaper-articles-to-omeka-s">Upload Trove newspaper articles to Omeka</a></strong> – Whether you’re creating on online exhibition or building a research database, Omeka can be very useful. This notebook connects Trove’s newspapers to Omeka for easy upload. Your selected articles can come from a search query, a Trove list, a Zotero library, or just a list of article ids. Metadata records are created in Omeka for each article and newspaper, and an image of each article is attached.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#get-ocrd-text-from-a-digitised-journal-in-trove">Get OCRd text from digitised periodicals in Trove</a></strong> – They’re often overshadowed by the newspapers, but there’s now lots of digitised journals, magazines, and parliamentary papers in Trove. You can get article-level data from the API, but not issue data. This notebook enables researchers to get metadata and OCRd text from every available issue of a periodical. To make researchers’ lives even easier, I regularly harvest <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#ocrd-text-from-trove-digitised-journals"><strong>all</strong> the available OCRd text</a> from digitised periodicals in Trove. The latest harvest downloaded 51,928 issues from 1,163 periodicals – that’s about 10gb of text. You can <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/trove-journals/blob/master/digital-journals-with-text.md">browse the list of periodicals</a> with OCRd text, or <a href="https://trove-digital-periodicals.glitch.me/data/trove-digital-journals">search this database</a>. All the OCRd text is stored in a public repository on CloudStor.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#get-covers-or-any-other-pages-from-a-digitised-journal-in-trove">Get page images from digitised periodicals in Trove</a></strong> – There’s more than text in digitised periodicals, and you might want to download images of pages for visual analysis. This notebook shows you how to get cover images, but could be easily modified to get another page, or a PDF. I used a modified version of this to create <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#editorial-cartoons-from-the-bulletin-1886-to-1952">a collection of 3,471 full page editorial cartoons</a> from <em>The Bulletin</em>, 1886 to 1952 – all available to download from CloudStor.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-books/#harvesting-the-text-of-digitised-books-and-ephemera">Get OCRd text from digitised books in Trove</a></strong> – Yep, there’s digitised books as well as newspapers and periodicals. You can download OCRd text from an individual book using the Trove web interface, but how do you make a collection of books without all that pointing and clicking? This notebook downloads all the available OCRd text from digitised books in Trove. The latest harvest includes <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-books/#ocrd-text-from-trove-books-and-ephemera">text from 26,762 works</a>. You can explore the results <a href="https://trove-digital-books.glitch.me/data/trove-digital-books">using this database</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#harvest-parliament-press-releases-from-trove">Harvest parliamentary press releases from Trove</a></strong> – Trove includes more than 380,000 press releases, speeches, and interview transcripts issued by Australian federal politicians and saved by the Parliamentary Library. This notebook shows you how to harvest both metadata and fulltext from a search of the parliamentary press releases. For example, here’s a collection of <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#politicians-talking-about-immigrants-and-refugees">politicians talking about ‘refugees’</a>, and another <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#politicians-talking-about-covid">relating to COVID-19</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-music/#harvest-abc-radio-national-records-from-trove">Harvest details of Radio National programs from Trove</a></strong> – Trove creates records for programs broadcast on ABC Radio National, for the major current affairs programs these records at at segment level. Even though they don’t provide full transcripts, this data provide a rich, fine-grained record of Australia’s recent political, social, and economic history. This notebook shows you how to download the Radio National data. If you just want to dive straight in, there’s also a <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-music/#abc-radio-national-programs">pre-harvested collection</a> containing more than 400,000 records, with separate downloads for some of the main programs.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#find-all-the-archived-versions-of-a-web-page">Find all the versions of an archived web page in Trove</a></strong> – Many of the tools in the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/">Web Archives section</a> of the GLAM Workbench will work with the Australian Web Archive, which is part of Trove. This notebook shows you how to get data about the number of times a web page has been archived over time.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#harvesting-collections-of-text-from-archived-web-pages">Harvesting collections of text from archived web pages in Trove</a></strong> – If you want to explore how the content of a web page changes over time, you can use this notebook to capture the text content of every archived version of a web page.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#convert-a-trove-list-into-a-csv-file">Convert a Trove list into a CSV file</a></strong> – While Trove provides a data download option for lists, it leaves out a lot of useful data. This notebook downloads full details of newspaper articles and other works in a list and saves them as CSV files. Like the Trove Newspaper Harvester, it lets you download OCRd text and images from newspaper articles.</li>
<li><strong>Collecting information about Trove user activity</strong> – It’s not just the content of Trove that provides interesting research data, it’s also the way people engage with it. Using the Trove API it’s possible to harvest details of <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/">all user created lists and tags</a>. And yes, there’s pre-harvested collections of <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#trove-lists-metadata">lists</a> and <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#trove-public-tags">tags</a> for the impatient.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I’m focusing here on Trove, there’s also tools to create datasets from the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/recordsearch/">National Archives of Australia</a>, <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/digitalnz/">Digital NZ and Papers Past</a>, the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/nma/">National Museum of Australia</a> and more. And there’s a <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/glam-data-list/">big list of readily downloadable datasets</a> from Australian GLAM organisations.</p>
<h2 id="visualisation-and-analysis">Visualisation and analysis</h2>
<p>Many of the notebooks listed above include examples that demonstrate ways of exploring and analysing your harvested data. There are also a number of companion notebooks that examine some possibilities in more detail, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/#exploring-your-troveharvester-data">Explore your Trove newspaper harvests</a></li>
<li><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/#display-the-results-of-a-harvest-as-a-searchable-database-using-datasette">Load your Trove newspaper harvest in Datasette</a></li>
<li><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-music/#exploring-abc-radio-national-metadata">Exploring ABC Radio National metadata</a></li>
<li><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#analyse-public-tags-added-to-trove">Analyse public tags added to Trove</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But there are also many other notebooks that demonstrate methods for analysing Trove’s content, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#querypic">QueryPic</a></strong> – Another tool that’s been around in different forms for a decade, QueryPic visualises searches in Trove’s newspapers. The latest web app couldn’t be simpler, just paste in your API key and a search url and create charts showing the number of matching articles over time. You can combine queries, change time scales, and download the data and visualisations.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#visualise-trove-newspaper-searches-over-time">Visualise Trove newspaper searches over time</a></strong> – This is like a deconstructed version of QueryPic that walks you through the process of using Trove’s facets to assemble a dataset of results over time. It provide a lot of detail on the sorts of data available, and the questions we can ask of it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#visualise-the-total-number-of-newspaper-articles-in-trove-by-year-and-state">Visualise the total number of newspaper articles in Trove by year and state</a></strong> – This notebook uses a modified version of the code above to analyse the construction and context of Trove’s newspaper corpus itself. What are you actually searching? Meet the WWI effect and the copyright cliff of death! This is a great place to start if you want to get people thinking critically about digital resources are constructed.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#analyse-rates-of-ocr-correction">Analyse rates of OCR correction</a></strong> – Some more meta-analysis of the Trove corpus itself, this time focusing on patterns of OCR correction by Trove users.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#finding-non-english-newspapers-in-trove">Identifying non-English language newspapers in Trove</a></strong> – There are a growing number of non-English language newspapers digitised in Trove. However, if you&rsquo;re only searching using English keywords, you might never know that they&rsquo;re there. This notebook analyses a sample of articles from every newspaper in Trove to identify non-English content.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#beyond-the-copyright-cliff-of-death">Beyond the copyright cliff of death</a></strong> – Most of the newspaper articles on Trove were published before 1955, but there are some from the later period. This notebook helps you find out how many, and which newspapers they were published in.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#map-trove-newspaper-results-by-state">Map Trove newspaper results by state</a></strong> – This notebook uses the Trove <code>state</code> facet to create a choropleth map that visualises the number of search results per state.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#map-trove-newspaper-results-by-place-of-publication">Map Trove newspaper results by place of publication</a></strong> – This notebook uses the Trove <code>title</code> facet to find the number of results per newspaper, then merges the results with a dataset of geolocated newspapers to map where articles were published.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#compare-two-versions-of-an-archived-web-page">Compare two versions of an archived web page</a></strong> – This notebook demonstrates a number of different ways of comparing versions of archived web pages. Just choose a repository, enter a url, and select two dates to see comparisons based on: page metadata, basic statistics such as file size and number of words, numbers of internal and external links, cosine similarity of text, line by line differences in text or code, and screenshots.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#display-changes-in-the-text-of-an-archived-web-page-over-time">Display changes in the text of an archived web page over time</a></strong> – This web app gathers all the available versions of a web page and then visualises changes in its content between versions – what’s been added, removed, and changed?</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#using-screenshots-to-visualise-change-in-a-page-over-time">Use screenshots to visualise change in a page over time</a></strong>– Create a series of full page screenshots of a web page over time, then assemble them into a time series.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also possibilities for using Trove data creatively. For example you can <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#create-scissors-and-paste-messages-from-trove-newspaper-articles">create &lsquo;scissors and paste&rsquo; messages from Trove newspaper articles</a>.</p>
<h2 id="documentation-and-examples">Documentation and examples</h2>
<p>All the Trove notebooks in the GLAM Workbench help document the possibilities and limits of the Trove API. The examples above can be modified and reworked to suit different research interests. Some notebooks also explore particular aspects of the API, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove/">Trove API Introduction</a></strong> – Some very basic examples of making requests and understanding results.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#todays-news-yesterday">Today’s news yesterday</a></strong> – Uses the <code>date</code> index and the <code>firstpageseq</code> parameter to find articles from exactly 100 years ago that were published on the front page. It then selects one of the articles at random and downloads and displays an image of the front page.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-images/#the-use-of-standard-licences-and-rights-statements-in-trove-image-records">The use of standard licences and rights statements in Trove image records</a></strong> – Version 2.1 of the Trove API introduced a new rights index that you can use to limit your search results to records that include one of a list of standard licences and rights statements. We can also use this index to build a picture of which rights statements are currently being used, and by who.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-random/">Random items from Trove</a></strong> – Changes to the Trove API meant that techniques you could previously use to select resources at random no longer work. This section documents some alternative ways of retrieving random-ish works and newspaper articles from Trove.</li>
</ul>
<p>And while it’s not officially part of the GLAM Workbench, I also maintain the <a href="https://troveconsole.herokuapp.com/">Trove API Console</a> which provides lots of examples of the API in action.</p>
<h2 id="pathways">Pathways</h2>
<p>In developing the GLAM Workbench I’m very aware that people will arrive with different levels of digital skill, confidence, and experience. That’s why I’ve been putting a lot of thought and effort into ways of providing a range of entry points.</p>
<p>Someone who might not identify as a ‘digital’ researcher can, with a single click, start up QueryPic and start exploring changes over time in Trove’s newspapers. This is possible because the GLAM Workbench is configured to <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/using-binder/">make use of Binder</a>, a service that spins up customised computing environments as needed.</p>
<p>Another researcher might start running the Trove Newspaper Harvester using Binder, but find that they want to run bigger and longer harvests. In that case, the GLAM Workbench offers a one-click installation of the Trove Newspaper Harvester on <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/using-reclaim-cloud/">Reclaim Cloud</a>. Unlike Binder, Reclaim Cloud environments are persistent, so you can run the harvester for as long as you want without the worry of interruptions.</p>
<p>Yet another researcher might want to understand how the Trove API works and the sorts of data that it makes available. By exploring the various notebooks they’ll find useful snippets of code they can try out in their own projects.</p>
<p>The GLAM Workbench connects outwards to make use of a range of other services – the notebooks run in Binder, Reclaim Cloud, and Docker; the code is all openly licensed and publicly available through GitHub and Zenodo; data is hosted on GitHub, CloudStor, and Zenodo; datasets can be explored using Datasette running on Glitch or Google CloudRun. I’m hoping that the new investments in HASS research infrastructure will embed a similar philosophy, connecting up existing services rather than starting from scratch.</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The future</h2>
<p>This is just an outline on what the GLAM Workbench currently offers researchers wanting to make use of the data available from Trove. It&rsquo;s all there now, publicly accessible, openly licensed, and ready to use – take it, use it, change it, share it. But there&rsquo;s <strong>much more</strong> I&rsquo;d like to do, both in regard to Trove and to encourage use of GLAM data more generally.

			<h1><a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/08/23/a-family-history.html">A Family History Month experiment – search millions of name records from GLAM organisations</a></h1>

			 <p>There’s a lot of rich historical data contained within the indexes that Australian GLAM organisations provide to help people navigate their records. These indexes, often created by volunteers, allow access by key fields such as name, date or location. They aid discovery, but also allow new forms of analysis and visualisation. Kate Bagnall and I wrote about some of the possibilities, and the difficulties, in this <a href="http://doi.org/10.1353/jwh.2021.0025">recently published article</a>.</p>
<p>Many of these indexes can be downloaded from government data portals. The GLAM Workbench demonstrates <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/glam-data-portals/">how these can be harvested</a>, and provides a <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/glam-datasets-from-gov-portals/">list of available datasets</a> to browse. But what’s inside them? The <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/csv-explorer/">GLAM CSV Explorer</a> visualises the contents of the indexes to give you a sneak peek and encourage you to dig deeper.</p>
<p>There’s even more indexes available from the NSW State Archives. Most of these aren’t accessible thought the NSW government data portal yet, but I managed to <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/nsw-state-archives/">scrape them from the website</a> a couple of years ago and made them <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/nsw-state-archives/#nsw-state-archives-online-indexes">available as CSVs</a> for easy download.</p>
<p>It’s <a href="https://familyhistorymonth.org.au/">Family History Month</a> at the moment, and the other night I thought of an interesting little experiment using the indexes. I’ve been playing round with <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> lately. It’s a fabulous tool for exploring tabular data, like CSVs. I also noticed that Datasette’s creator Simon Willison had added a <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Mar/9/datasette-search-all/">search-all plugin</a> that enabled you to run a full text search across multiple databases and tables. Hmmm, I wondered, would it be possible to use Datasette to provide a way of searching for names across <strong>all</strong> those GLAM indexes?</p>
<p>After a few nights work, I found the answer was <strong>yes</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/name-search/">Try out my new aggregated search interface here!</a></strong>.</p>
<p>(The cloud service it uses runs on demand, so if it has gone to sleep, it might take a little while to wake up again – just be patient for a few seconds.)</p>
<p><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/name-search/"><img src="https://updates.timsherratt.org/uploads/2021/bf9da8208a.png" alt="" title="Scrrenshot of GLAM Name index search"></a></p>
<p>Currently, the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/name-search/">GLAM Name Search</a> interface lets you search for names across 195 indexes from eight GLAM organisations. All together, there’s a total of more than <strong>9.2 million rows of data</strong> to explore!</p>
<p>It’s simple to use – just enter a name in the search box and Datasette will search each index in turn, displaying the first five matching results. You can click through to view all results from a specific index. Not surprisingly, the aggregated name search only searches columns containing names. However, once you click through to an individual table, you can apply additional filters or facets.</p>
<p>To create the aggregated search interface I worked through the <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/ozglam-data/blob/master/glam-datasets-from-gov-portals-csvs.csv">list of CSVs</a> I’d harvested from government data portals to identify those that contained names of people, and discard those that contained administrative, rather than historical data. I also made a note of the columns that contained the names so I could index their contents once they’d been added to the database. Usually these were fields such as <code>Surname</code> or <code>Given names</code>, but sometimes names were in the record title or notes.</p>
<p>Datasette uses SQLite databases to store its data. I decided to create one database for each GLAM organisation. I wrote some code to work through my list of datasets, saving them into an SQLite database, indexing the name columns, and writing information about the dataset to a <code>metadata.json</code> file. This file is used by Datasette to display information such as the title, source, licence, and last modified date of each of the indexes.</p>
<p>Once that was done, I could fire up Datasette and feed it all the SQLite databases. Amazingly it all worked – searching across all the indexes was remarkably quick! To make it publicly available I used the Datasette <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/publish.html"><code>publish</code></a> to push everything to Google CloudRun (about 1.4 gb of data). The first time I used CloudRun it took some time to get the authentication and other settings working properly. This time was much smoother. Before long it was live!</p>
<p>Once I knew it all worked, I decided to add in another 59 indexes from the NSW State Archives. I also plugged in a few extra indexes from the Public Record Office of Victoria. These datasets are stored as ZIP files in the Victorian government data portal, so it took a little bit of extra manual processing to get everything sorted. But finally I had all <strong>195 indexes</strong> loaded.</p>
<p>What now? That depends on whether people find this experiment useful. I have a few ideas for improvements. But if people do use it, then the costs will go up. I’m going to have to monitor this over the next couple of months to see if I can afford to keep it going. If you want to help with the running costs, you might like to sign up as a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/wragge?o=esb">GitHub sponsor</a>.</p>
<p><strong>And please let me know if you think it’s worth developing!</strong> #dhhacks</p>

			 <p>The <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-books/">Trove books section of the GLAM Workbench </a>has been updated! There’s freshly-harvested data, as well as updated Python packages, integration with Reclaim Cloud, and automated Docker builds.</p>
<p>Included is <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-books/#harvesting-the-text-of-digitised-books-and-ephemera">a notebook to harvest details of all books</a> available from Trove in digital form. This includes both digitised books, that have been scanned and OCRd, as well as born digital publications, such as PDFs and epubs. The definition of ‘books’ is pretty loose – I’ve harvested details of anything that has been assigned the format ‘Book’ in Trove, but this includes <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/08/13/a-miscellany-of.html">ephemera, such as posters, pamphlets, and advertising</a>.</p>
<p>In the latest harvest, I ended up with details of 42,174 ‘books’. This includes some duplicates, because multiple metadata entries can point to the same digital object. I thought it was best to preserve the duplicates, rather than discard the metadata.</p>
<p>Once I’d harvested the details of the books, I tried to see if there was any OCRd text available for download. If there was, I saved it to a <a href="https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/ugiw3gdijSKaoTL">public folder on CloudStor</a>. In total, I was able to download 26,762 files of OCRd text.</p>
<p><img src="https://updates.timsherratt.org/uploads/2021/7b5774a071.png" alt="Screenshot of database showing details of digital book"></p>
<p>The easiest way to explore the books is <a href="https://trove-digital-books.glitch.me/data/trove-digital-books">using this searchable database</a>. It’s created using Datasette and is running on Glitch. Full text search is available on the ‘title’ and ‘contributors’ fields, and you can filter on things like date, copyright status, number of pages, and whether OCRd text is available for download. If there is OCRd text, a direct link to the file on CloudStor is included. You can use the database to filter the titles, creating your own dataset that you can download in CSV or JSON format.</p>
<p>If you just want the full list of books as a CSV file, you can <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/trove-books/blob/master/trove_digitised_books_with_ocr.csv">download it here</a>. And if you want <em>all</em> the OCRd text, you can go straight to the <a href="https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/ugiw3gdijSKaoTL">public folder on CloudStor</a> – there’s about 3.6gb of text files to explore! #dhhacks</p>

			 <p>I’m just in the midst of updating my harvest of OCRd text from Trove’s digitised books (more about that soon!). But amongst the items catalogued as ‘books’ are a wide assortment of ephemera, posters, advertisements, and other oddities. There’s no consistent way of identifying these items through the search interface, but because I’ve found the number of pages in each ‘book’ as part of the harvesting process, I can limit results to items with just a single digitised page – there’s more than 1,500! To make it easy to explore this collection of odds and ends, I’ve downloaded all the single page images and compiled them into <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xi84y12zz6iryfu/trove-ephemera.pdf?dl=0">one big PDF</a> with links back to their entries in Trove. Enjoy your browsing!</p>
<p><img src="https://updates.timsherratt.org/uploads/2021/1f185ad85f.png" alt="" title="Screenshot from PDF showing a 'To let' poster"></p>
<p>This is another example of the ways in which we can extend and enrich existing collection interfaces using simple technologies like PDFs and CSVs. We can create slices across existing categories to expose interesting features, and provide new entry points for researchers. Some other examples in the GLAM Workbench are the collection of <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#editorial-cartoons-from-the-bulletin-1886-to-1952">editorial cartoons from <em>The Bulletin</em></a>, the list of Trove newspapers with <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#trove-newspapers-with-non-english-language-content">non-English content</a>, the harvest of <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-music/#abc-radio-national-programs">ABC Radio National programs</a>, and the recent collection of <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#politicians-talking-about-covid">politicians talking about COVID</a>. <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/suggest-a-topic/">Let me know</a> if you have any ideas for additional slices! #dhhacks</p>

			 <p>Some good news on the funding front with the success of the <a href="https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/Web/Grant/Grant/LP200301446">Everyday Heritage project</a> in the latest round of ARC Linkage grants. The project aims to look beyond the formal discourses of ‘national’ heritage to develop a more diverse range of heritage narratives. Working at the intersection of place, digital collections, and material culture, team members will develop a series of ‘heritage biographies’, that document everyday experience, and provide new models for the heritage sector.</p>
<p><img src="https://updates.timsherratt.org/uploads/2021/37dbda004e.png" alt="Screen capture of project details in ARC grants database"></p>
<p>Digital methods will play a major role in the project. I’ll be leading the ‘Heritage Hacks’ work package that will support the creation of the heritage biographies and develop a range of new tools and tutorials for use in heritage management contexts. All the tools, methods, and data generated through the project will be documented using Jupyter notebooks and published through the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/">GLAM Workbench</a>.

			 <p>For a few years now I’ve been harvesting downloadable text from digitised periodicals in Trove and making it easily available for exploration and research. I’ve just completed the latest harvest – here’s the summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>1,163 digitised periodicals had text available for download</li>
<li>Text was downloaded from 51,928 individual issues</li>
<li>Adding up to a total of around 12gb of text</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to dive straight in, here’s a <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/trove-journals/blob/master/digital-journals-with-text.md">list of all the harvested periodicals</a>, with links to download a summary of available issues, as well as all the harvested text (there’s one file per issue). You’ll notice that the list includes a large number of parliamentary papers and government reports as well as published journals.</p>
<p><img src="https://updates.timsherratt.org/uploads/2021/008359faba.png" alt="List of Trove periodicals with downloadable text"></p>
<p>All of the harvested text is available from a <a href="https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/QOmnqpGQCNCSC2h">public folder on CloudStor</a>.</p>
<p>The harvesting process involves a few different steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>First I generate a list of periodicals available in digital form from Trove. This includes digitised titles, as well as born-digital titles submitted through e-Legal Deposit. This produced <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#csv-formatted-list-of-journals-available-from-trove-in-digital-form">a CSV file</a> containing the details of 7,270 titles. See <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#create-a-list-of-troves-digitised-journals">this notebook</a> for details.</li>
<li>Then I work through this list of titles to find out how many issues of each title are available through Trove. This information isn’t accessible through the API, so I have to do some screen scraping.</li>
<li>Next I work through the list of issues and try to download the text contents. Most of the born-digital titles don’t have downloadable text.</li>
<li>Once I’ve downloaded all the text I can from a title, I create a CSV file for it that lists the available issues and notes whether text is available for each. This file is stored with the text on CloudStor.</li>
<li>Once I’ve checked all the titles, I generate <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#csv-formatted-list-of-journals-with-ocrd-text">another CSV file</a> that lists the details of all the periodicals that have downloadable text.</li>
<li>The code to harvest and document the downloaded text is <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#download-the-ocrd-text-for-all-the-digitised-journals-in-trove">available in this notebook</a>. #dhhacks</li>

			 <p>The <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/">Trove Journals</a> section of the GLAM Workbench includes <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-journals/#harvest-parliament-press-releases-from-trove">a notebook</a> that helps you download press releases, speeches, and interview transcripts by Australian federal politicians. These documents are compiled and published by the Parliamentary Library, and the details are regularly harvested into Trove.</p>
<p>Using this notebook, I’ve created a collection of documents that include the words ‘COVID’ or ‘Coronavirus’. It includes all the <strong>metadata</strong> from Trove, as well as the <strong>full text</strong> of each document downloaded from the Parliamentary Library. There’s <strong>3,995 documents in total</strong>, covering the period up until early April 2021. You can <strong><a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/trove-journals/raw/6f4d805186716853b81c7d93cac6754685b384bf/press-releases/press-releases-coronavirus-or-covid.zip">download them all as a zip file</a></strong> (12 mb).</p>
<p><img src="https://updates.timsherratt.org/uploads/2021/44a7f87b2c.png" alt="" title="Screenshot showing a sample of the harvested metadata"></p>
<p>While I was compiling this dataset, I also made a few improvements to the notebook. You can now filter the results to weed out false positives, and identify duplicates. #dhhacks</p>

			 <p>I’ve always been interested in the way people add value to resources in Trove. OCR correction tends to get all the attention, but Trove users have also been busy organising resources using tags, lists, and comments. I used to refer to tagging quite often in <a href="http://discontents.com.au/myths-mega-projects-and-making/">presentations</a>, pointing to the different ways they were used. For example, ‘TBD’ is a workflow marker, used by text correctors to label articles that are ‘To Be Done’. My favourite was ‘LRRSA’, one of the most heavily-used tags across the whole of Trove. What does it mean? It stands for the Light Rail Research Society of Australia, and the tag is used by members to mark items of shared interest. It’s a great example of how something as simple as plain text tags can be used to support collaboration and build communities.</p>
<p><img src="https://updates.timsherratt.org/uploads/2021/f76b2e110b.png" alt="Word cloud showing the top 200 Trove tags"></p>
<p>Until its update last year, Trove used to provide some basic stats about user activity. There was also a tag cloud that let you explore the most commonly-used tags. It’s now much harder to access this sort of information. However, you can extract some basic information about tags from the Trove API. First of all, you can filter a search using ‘has:tags’ to limit the results to items that have tags attached to them. Then to find out what the tags actually are, you can add the <code>include=tags</code> parameter. This embeds the tags within the item record, so you can work through a set of results, extracting all the tags as you go. To save you the trouble, I’ve done this for the whole of Trove, and ended up with <strong>a dataset containing more than 8 million tags</strong>!</p>
<p><img src="https://updates.timsherratt.org/uploads/2021/6ef630ccef.png" alt="Chart showing the number of tags per year and zone."></p>
<p>The dataset is saved as a 500mb CSV file, and contains the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tag</code> – lower-cased version of the tag</li>
<li><code>date</code> – date the tag was added</li>
<li><code>zone</code> – the API zone that contains the tagged resource</li>
<li><code>resource_id</code> – the identifier of he tagged resource</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a few things to note about the data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Works (such as books) in Trove can have tags attached at either work or version level. This dataset aggregates all tags at the work level, removing any duplicates.</li>
<li>A single resource in Trove can appear in multiple zones – for example, a book that includes maps and illustrations might appear in the &lsquo;book&rsquo;, &lsquo;picture&rsquo;, and &lsquo;map&rsquo; zones. This means that some of the tags will essentially be duplicates – harvested from different zones, but relating to the same resource. Depending on your interests, you might want to remove these duplicates.</li>
<li>While most of the tags were added by Trove users, more than 500,000 tags were added by Trove itself in November 2009. I think these tags were automatically generated from related Wikipedia pages. Depending on your interests, you might want to exclude these by limiting the date range or zones.</li>
<li>User content added to Trove, including tags, is available for reuse under a CC-BY-NC licence.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download the complete dataset from <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5094314">Zenodo</a>, or from <a href="https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/YiWStNrhnTo18JI">CloudStor</a>. For more information on how I harvested the data, and some of its limits and complexities, see the notebooks in the new <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-lists/#tags">‘Tags’ section in the GLAM Workbench</a>. There’s also some examples of analysing and visualising the tags. As an extra bonus, there’s a more compact <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/trove-lists/blob/master/trove_tag_counts_20210710.csv">50mb CSV dataset</a> which lists each unique tag and the number of times it has been used.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s worth remembering that this sort of dataset is out of date before the harvest is even finished. More tags are being added all the time! But hopefully this data will help us better understand the way people work to organise and enrich complex resources like Trove. #dhhacks</p>

			 <p>I’ve spent a lot of time this year working on ways of improving the GLAM Workbench’s documentation and its integration with other services. Last year I created <a href="https://ozglam.chat/">OzGLAM Help</a> to provide a space where users of GLAM collections could ask questions and share discoveries – including a dedicated <a href="https://ozglam.chat/c/glam-workbench/8">GLAM Workbench channel</a>. Earlier this year, I tweaked my Micro.blog powered updates to include a dedicated <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/categories/glamworkbench">GLAM Workbench news feed</a>. Now I’ve brought the two together! What does this mean?</p>
<ul>
<li>Any GLAM Workbench news that I post to my updates feed is now automatically added to OzGLAM Help</li>
<li>Links are automatically added to items in the news feed that let you add comments or questions in OzGLAM Help</li>
</ul>
<p>So now there’s two-way communication between the services providing more ways for people to discover and discuss how the GLAM Workbench can help them.</p>

			 <p>I’ve started creating short videos to introduce or explain various components of the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/">GLAM Workbench</a>. The first video shows how you can visualise searches in Trove’s digitised newspapers using the latest version of QueryPic. It’s a useful introduction to the way access to collection data enables us to ask different types of questions of historical sources.</p>

<p>As with all GLAM Workbench resources, the video is openly-licensed – so feel free to stop it into your own course materials or workshops. It could, for example, provide an interesting little digital methods task in an Australian history unit.</p>
<p>I’ll be creating a second QueryPic video shortly, demonstrating how you can work with complex queries and differing timescales. Let me know if you find it useful, or if you have any ideas for future topics. #dhhacks</p>

			 <p>An <a href="http://doi.org/10.1353/jwh.2021.0025">article written by Kate Bagnall and me</a> has just been published in a special issue of the <em>Journal of World History</em> focusing on digital history. And it’s open access!</p>
<p>The article is ‘Missing Links: Data Stories from the Archive of British Settler Colonial Citizenship’. In it we document our efforts to assemble a number of different datasets relating to naturalization. Here’s the abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Digitized sources and digital methods are changing the way that we do history. For historians of the British Empire, the digital age offers new possibilities for investigating the lives of those who moved around the empire and across the world. However, much discussion of the possibilities and problems of digital history have focused on the creation and use of full text resources, skipping over the analytical opportunities offered by the descriptive systems in which those texts are embedded. This article is an attempt to fill this gap by documenting a journey through archival data relating to nineteenth-century Chinese naturalization in the Pacific Rim settler colonies of Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. We argue that such data stories are critical if we are to understand both possibilities and pitfalls of research in digital collections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s also an <a href="https://github.com/wragge/naturalization-data-stories">GitHub repository</a> with code and data related to the article.</p>

			 <p>QueryPic is a tool to visualise searches in Trove’s digitised newspapers. I created the first version <a href="http://discontents.com.au/mining-the-treasures-of-trove-part-2/">way back in 2011</a>, and since then it’s taken a number of different forms. The latest version introduces some new features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automatic query creation</strong> – construct your search in the Trove web interface, then just copy and paste the url into QueryPic. This means you can take advantage of Trove’s advanced search and facets to build complex queries.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple time scales</strong> – previous versions only aggregated search results by year, but now you can also aggregate by month, or by day. QueryPic will automatically choose a time unit based on the date range of your query, but if you’re not happy with the result you can change it!</li>
<li><strong>Links back to Trove</strong> – click on any of the points on the chart to search Trove within that time period. This enables you to zoom in and out of your results, from the high-level visualisation, to individual articles.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://updates.timsherratt.org/uploads/2021/b02780ed6c.png" alt="Screenshot of QueryPic chart"></p>
<p>This version of QueryPic is built within a Jupyter notebook, and designed to run using Voila (which hides all the code and makes the notebook look like a web app). See the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#querypic">Trove Newspapers section</a> of the GLAM Workbench for more information. If you’d like to give it a try, just click the button below to run it live using Binder.</p>

My fellow panellists described some amazing stuff going on in European cultural heritage organisations to support researchers who want to make use of web archives.

			 <p>When the 1-click installer for Reclaim Cloud works its magic and turns GLAM Workbench repositories into your own, personal digital labs, it creates a new <code>work</code> directory mounted inside of your main Jupyter directory. This new directory is independent of the Docker image used to run Jupyter, so it’s a handy place to copy things if you ever want to update the Docker image. However, I just realised that there was a permissions problem with the <code>work</code> directory which meant you couldn’t write files to it from within Jupyter.</p>
<p>To fix the problem, I’ve added an extra line to the <code>reclaim-manifest.jps</code> config file to make the Jupyter user the owner of the <code>work</code> directory:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>	- cmd[cp]: chown -R jovyan:jovyan /home/jovyan/work
</code></pre><p>This takes care of any new installations. If you have an existing installation, you can either just create a completely new environment using the updated config, or you can manually change the permissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hover over the name of your environment in the control panel to display the option buttons.</li>
<li>Click on the Settings button. A new box will open at the bottom of the control panel with all the settings options.</li>
<li>Click on &lsquo;SSH Access&rsquo; in the left hand menu of the settings box.</li>
<li>Click on the &lsquo;SSH Connection&rsquo; tab.</li>
<li>Under &lsquo;Web SSH&rsquo; click on the Connect button and select the default node.</li>
<li>A terminal session will open. At the command line enter the following:</li>

			 <p>I’ve been working on an essay for publication in a forthcoming edited collection. I wanted to explore how the practice of history in Australia had been changed by GLAM organisations making their collections available online – both the new possibilities that had emerged, and the problems that remained. In the end I focused on three areas – discovery, digitisation, and research infrastructure. If you’re interested, I’ve <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4925423">shared a preprint on Zenodo</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a taste:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just twenty years ago, historical research often entailed long hours spent at a microfilm reader, browsing newspaper after newspaper in the hope of finding something relevant. The changes wrought by Trove, and other digital collections, seem revolutionary, but as with all revolutions there have been gains and losses. Alongside the wonders wrought by digitisation, this chapter has tried to highlight some of the paths not taken. The online resources we now use daily are not simply the products of technology – priorities have been set, funding has been distributed, decisions made about what to include and what to leave out. Cultural heritage collections are not just put online, they are placed within specific contexts of discovery and use. Each object, each version, each interface comes with a set of limitations and affordances that together determine what is possible. We do not know yet how these decisions will shape the sorts of histories that we write.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I enjoyed reminding myself about some early digital initiatives in the GLAM sector, but as is usual with these sorts of projects, I had to leave a lot out. It’s made me think about developing a larger project documenting our gains and losses.</p>

			 <p>Here’s a <a href="https://github.com/wragge/trove_query_parser/">new little Python package</a> that you might find useful. It simply takes a search url from Trove’s Newspapers &amp; Gazettes category and converts it into a set of parameters that you can use to request data from the Trove API. While some parameters are used both in the web interface and the API, there are a lot of variations – this package means you don’t have to keep track of all the differences!</p>
<p>It’s very simple to use.</p>

<p>The code for the parser has been basically lifted from the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/troveharvester/">Trove Newspaper Harvester</a>.

			 <p>I deliberately don’t keep any stats about GLAM Workbench visits, because I think they’re pretty meaningless. On the other hand, I’m always interested to see how often GLAM Workbench repositories are launched on <a href="https://archive.analytics.mybinder.org/">Binder</a>. Rather than just random clicks, these numbers represent the number of times users started new computing sessions using the GLAM Workbench. I just compiled these stats for the past year, and I was very pleased to see that the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/">Web Archives</a> section has been launched over 1,000 times in the past twelve months! The <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/">Trove Newspapers</a> and <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-harvester/">Trove Newspaper Harvester</a> repositories are also well used – on average these are both being launched more than once a day.</p>
<p><img src="https://updates.timsherratt.org/uploads/2021/3aa3ee045b.png" alt="Binder launches of GLAM Workbench repositories, 1 June 2020 to 2 June 2021."></p>
<p>The GLAM Workbench is never going to attract massive numbers of users – it’s all about <em>being there</em> when a researcher needs help to use GLAM collections. One or two launches per day means one or two researchers from somewhere around the world are able to explore new datasets, or ask new questions. I think that’s pretty important.</p>

			 <p>My program of rolling out new features and integrations across the GLAM Workbench continues. The latest section to be updated is the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/">Web Archives</a> section!</p>
<p>There are no new notebooks with this update, but some important changes under the hood. If you haven’t used it before, the Web Archives section contains 16 notebooks providing documentation, tools, apps, and examples to help you make use of web archives in your research. The notebooks are grouped by the following topics: <strong>Types of data</strong>, <strong>Harvesting data and creating datasets</strong>, and <strong>Exploring change over time</strong>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I’ve updated all the Python packages used in this repository and changed the app-ified notebooks to run using Voila (which is better integrated with Jupyter Lab than Appmode). But most importantly, you can now install the repository into your own persistent environment using <a href="https://reclaim.cloud/">Reclaim Cloud</a> or Docker.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://circulatingnow.nlm.nih.gov/2021/05/13/exploring-the-data-of-web-archives-as-part-of-data-science-nlm/">Christie Moffatt noted recently</a> harvesting data from web archives can take a long time, and you might hit the limits of the free Binder service. These new integrations mean you don’t have to worry about your notebooks timing out. Just click on the <strong>Launch on Reclaim Cloud</strong> button and you can have your own fully-provisioned, persistent environment up and running in minutes!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is possible because every change to the Web Archives repository now triggers the build of a new Docker image with all the software that you need pre-installed. You can also run this Docker image on your own computer, or using another cloud service.</p>
<p>The Web Archives section now <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#run-these-notebooks">includes documentation</a> on running the notebooks using Binder, Reclaim, Cloud or Docker. #dhhacks</p>

<p>I say <em>approximately</em> because the only public source of this information are web archives like the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine</a> and <a href="https://webarchive.nla.gov.au/collection">Trove itself</a>. By downloading <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/titles">captures of Trove’s browse page</a>, I was able to extract a list of newspaper titles available <strong>when that capture was made</strong>. Depending on the frequency of captures, the titles may have been first made available some time earlier.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#gathering-historical-data-about-the-addition-of-newspaper-titles-to-trove">method I used</a> to create the dataset is documented in the Trove Newspapers section of the GLAM Workbench. I used the Internet Archive as my source rather than Trove just because there were more captures available. Most of the code I could conveniently copy from the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/">Web Archives</a> section of the GLAM Workbench, in particular the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/web-archives/#find-all-the-archived-versions-of-a-web-page">Find all the archived versions of a particular web page</a> notebook.</p>
<p>The result was actually two datasets:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/trove-newspapers/blob/master/trove_newspaper_titles_2009_2021.csv">trove_newspaper_titles_2009_2021.csv</a>  – complete dataset of captures and titles</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/trove-newspapers/blob/master/trove_newspaper_titles_first_appearance_2009_2021.csv">trove_newspaper_titles_first_appearance_2009_2021.csv</a>  – filtered dataset, showing only the first appearance of each title / place / date range combination</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s also an <a href="https://gist.github.com/wragge/7d80507c3e7957e271c572b8f664031a">alphabetical list of newspaper titles</a> for easy browsing. The list shows the date of the capture in which the title was first recorded, as well as any changes to its date range. #dhhacks</p>

			 <p>I’ve updated, refreshed, and reorganised the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/">Trove newspapers section</a> of the GLAM Workbench.  There’s currently 22 Jupyter notebooks organised under the following headings:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#trove-newspapers-in-context"><strong>Trove newspapers in context</strong></a> – Notebooks in this section look at the Trove newspaper corpus as a whole, to try and understand what’s there, and what’s not.</li>

<li><a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#get-creative"><strong>Get creative</strong></a> – Notebooks in this section look at ways you can use data from Trove newspapers in creative ways.</li>

<p>There’s also a number of pre-harvested datasets.</p>

</ul>
<p>As part of the update, notebooks that are intended to run as apps (with all the code hidden) have been updated to use Voila. But perhaps the thing I’m most excited about are the new options for <strong>running</strong> the notebooks. As well as being able to launch the notebooks on Binder, you can now create your very own, <strong>persistent</strong> environment on Reclaim Cloud with just a click of a button.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There’s also an automatically-built Docker image of this repository, containing everything you need to run the notebooks on your own computer. Check out the new <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/#run-these-notebooks">Run these notebooks</a>  section for details. I’m gradually rolling this out across all the repositories in the GLAM Workbench. #dhhacks</p>

			<h1><a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/04/27/introducing-the-new.html">Introducing the new, improved RecordSearch Data Scraper!</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/04/27/introducing-the-new.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-04-27 09:55:00 &#43;1000">Apr 27, 2021</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>It was way back in 2009 that I created <a href="http://discontents.com.au/some-archives-hacking/">my first scraper</a> for getting machine-readable data out of the National Archives of Australia&rsquo;s online database, RecordSearch. Since then I’ve used versions of this scraper in a number of different projects such as <a href="https://www.realfaceofwhiteaustralia.net/">The Real Face of White Australia</a>, <a href="https://closedaccess.herokuapp.com/">Closed Access</a>, and <a href="https://owebrowse.herokuapp.com/redactions/">Redacted</a> (including the <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/04/21/secrets-and-lives.html">recent update</a>). The scraper is also embedded in many of the notebooks that I’ve created for the <a href="https://glam-workbench.net/recordsearch/">RecordSearch section</a> of the GLAM Workbench.</p>
<p>However, the scraper was showing its age. The main problem was that one of its dependencies, Robobrowser, is no longer maintained. This made it difficult to update. I&rsquo;d put off a major rewrite, thinking that RecordSearch itself might be getting a much-needed overhaul, but I could wait no longer. Introducing the brand new <a href="https://github.com/wragge/recordsearch_data_scraper">RecordSearch Data Scraper</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Just like the old version, the new scraper delivers machine-readable data relating to Items, Series and Agencies – both from individual records, and search results. It also adds a little extra to the basic metadata, for example, if an Item is digitised, the data includes the number of pages in the file. Series records can include the number of digitised files, and the breakdown of files by access category.</p>
<p>The new scraper adds in some additional search parameters for Series and Agencies. It also makes use of a simple caching system to improve speed and efficiency.  RecordSearch makes use of an odd assortment of sessions, redirects, and hidden forms, which make scraping a challenge. Hopefully I’ve nailed down the idiosyncrasies, but I expect to catching bugs for a while.</p>
<p>I created the new scraper in Jupyter using <a href="https://github.com/fastai/nbdev">NBDev</a>. NBDev helps you to keep your code, examples, tests, and documentation all together in Jupyter notebooks. When you&rsquo;re ready, it converts the code from the notebooks  into distributable Python libraries, runs all your tests, and builds a <a href="https://wragge.github.io/recordsearch_data_scraper/">documentation site</a>. It’s very cool.</p>
<p>Having updated the scraper, I now need to update the notebooks in the GLAM Workbench – more on that soon. The maintenance never ends! #dhhacks</p>

			<h1><a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/03/29/recently-digitised-files.html">Recently digitised files in the National Archives of Australia</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/03/29/recently-digitised-files.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-03-29 09:00:00 &#43;1000">Mar 29, 2021</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’m interested in understanding what gets digitised and when by our cultural institutions, but accessible data is scarce. The National Archives of Australia lists ‘newly scanned' records in RecordSearch, so I thought I’d see if I could convert that list into a machine-readable form for analysis. I’ve had a lot of experience trying to <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/recordsearch/">get data out of RecordSearch</a>, but even so it took me a while to figure out how the ‘newly scanned’ page worked. Eventually I was able to extract all the file metadata from the list and save it to a CSV file. The details are in <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/recordsearch/#harvest-recently-digitised-files-from-recordsearch">this notebook in the GLAM Workbench</a>.</p>
<p>I used the code to create a dataset of <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/recordsearch/blob/master/data/recently-digitised-20210327">all the files digitised in the past month</a>. The ‘newly scanned' list only displays a month&rsquo;s worth of additions, so that&rsquo;s as much as I could get in one hit. In the past month, 24,039 files were digitised. 22,500 of these (about 93%) come from just four series of military records. This is no surprise, as the NAA is currently undertaking a major project to digitise WW2 service records. What is perhaps more interesting is the long tail of series from which a small number of files were digitised. 357 of the 375 series represented in the dataset (about 95%) appear 20 or fewer times. 210 series have had only one file digitised in the last month. I’m assuming that this diversity represents research interests, refracted through the digitisation on demand  service. But this really needs more data, and more analysis.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As I mentioned, only one month&rsquo;s data is available from RecordSearch at any time. To try and capture a longer record of the digitisation process, I’ve set up an automated <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/">‘git scraper’</a> that runs every Sunday and captures metadata of all the files digitised in the preceding week. The weekly datasets are saved as CSV files in a <a href="https://github.com/wragge/naa-recently-digitised">public GitHub repository</a>. Over time, this should become a useful dataset for exploring long-term patterns in digitisation. #dhhacks</p>

			 <p>Over the last few years, I&rsquo;ve been very grateful for the support of my Patreon subscribers. Financially, their contributions have helped me cover a substantial proportion of the cloud hosting costs associated with projects like <a href="https://historichansard.net/">Historic Hansard</a> and <a href="https://www.realfaceofwhiteaustralia.net/">The Real Face of White Australia</a>. But, more importantly, just knowing that they thought my work was of value has helped keep me going, and inspired me to develop a range of new resources.</p>
<p>However, while I&rsquo;ve been grateful for the platform provided by Patreon, I&rsquo;ve increasingly felt that it&rsquo;s not a good fit for the sort of work I do. Patreon is geared towards providing special content to supporters, but, as you know, all my work is open. And that&rsquo;s really important to me.</p>
<p>Recently GitHub opened up its own sponsorship program for the development of open source software. This program seems to align more closely with what I do. I already share and manage my code through GitHub, so integrating sponsorship seems to make a lot of sense. It&rsquo;s worth noting too, that, unlike Patreon, GitHub charges no fees and takes no cut of your contributions. As a result I&rsquo;ve decided to close my Patreon account by the end of April, and create a GitHub sponsors page.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-you">What does this mean for you?</h2>
<p><strong>If you&rsquo;re a Patreon subscriber and you&rsquo;d like to keep supporting me</strong>, you should cancel your Patreon contribution, then head over to my brand new <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/wragge"><strong>GitHub sponsors page</strong></a> and sign up! Thanks for your continued support!</p>
<p><strong>If you&rsquo;d prefer to let your contributions lapse</strong>, just do nothing. Your payments will stop when I close the account at the end of April. I understand that circumstances change – thank you so much for your support over the years, and I hope you will continue to make use of the things I create.</p>
<p><strong>If you make use of any of my tools or resources and would like to support their continued development</strong>, please think about <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/wragge">becoming a sponsor</a>. For a sample of the sorts of things I&rsquo;ve been working on lately, see my <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/">updates feed</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The future!</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m very excited about the possibilities ahead. The <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/">GLAM Workbench</a> has received a lot of attention around the world (including a <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/awards/#british-library-lab-awards-2020">Research Award</a> from the British Library Labs), and I&rsquo;m planning some <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2021/03/25/reclaim-cloud-integration.html">major developments</a> over coming months. And, of course, I won&rsquo;t forget all my other resources – I spent a lot of time in 2020 migrating databases and platforms to keep everything chugging along.</p>
<p>On my <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/wragge">GitHub sponsors page</a>, I&rsquo;ve set an initial target of 50 sponsors. That might be ambitious, but as I said above, it&rsquo;s not just about money. Being able to point to a group of people who use and value this work will help me argue for new ways of enabling digital research in the humanities. So please help me spread the word – let&rsquo;s make things together!</p>

			 <p>I’ve been doing a bit of work behind the scenes lately to prepare for a major update to the <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/">GLAM Workbench</a>. My plan is to provide one click installation of any of the GLAM Workbench repositories on the <a href="https://reclaim.cloud/">Reclaim Cloud</a> platform. This will provide a useful step up from Binder for any researcher who wants to do large-scale or sustained work using the GLAM Workbench. Reclaim Cloud is a paid service, but they do a great job supporting digital scholarship in the humanities, and it’s fairly easy to minimise your costs by shutting down environments when they&rsquo;re not in use.</p>
<p>I’ve still got a lot of work to do to roll this out across the GLAM Workbench&rsquo;s 40 repositories, but if you&rsquo;d like a preview head to the <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/trove-newspaper-harvester">Trove Newspaper and Gazette Harvester repository</a> on GitHub. Get yourself a Reclaim Cloud account and click on the <strong>Launch on Reclaim Cloud</strong> button. It&rsquo;s that easy!</p>

			 <p>It was Open Data Day on Saturday 6 March – here’s some of the ready-to-go datasets you can find in the <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/">GLAM Workbench</a> – there’s something for historians, humanities researchers, teachers &amp; more!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First here’s a <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/glam-data-list/">list of Australian GLAM (that’s galleries, libraries, archives &amp; museums) data sources</a>. It includes APIs, portals, and downloadable datasets. Suggested additions welcome!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There’s also a <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/glam-datasets-from-gov-portals/">list of Australian GLAM datasets that are available through government open data portals</a>. There’s hundreds of them, but they’re not always easy to find. Convicts, immigration, hospitals, WWI – includes lots of useful biographical data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you’re not sure where to start with a list of 600 CSV files, have a look at the <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/csv-explorer/">GLAM CSV Explorer</a>! Select a file and this Jupyter-powered app will build a series of visualisations based on the contents of each column.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While they’re not yet in an open data portal, NSW State Archives has a rich collection of indexes transcribed by volunteers. I’ve scraped 64 indexes, with over 1.4 million rows of data and <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/nsw-state-archives/#nsw-state-archives-online-indexes">put them in a repository for easy download.</a> There’s even a <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/nsw-state-archives/#nsw-state-archives-index-explorer">version of the CSV Explorer</a>, just for the NSW State Archives indexes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-newspapers/#csv-formatted-list-of-australian-womens-weekly-issues-1933-to-1982">CSV file</a> containing details of every issue of the Australian Women’s Weekly in Trove.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-newspapers/#australian-womens-weekly-front-covers-1933-to-1982">collection of front covers from the Australian Women’s Weekly from 1933 to 1982</a>! That’s 2,566 images you can download from Cloudstor or browse in a series of convenient PDFs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-newspapers/#trove-newspapers-with-non-english-language-content">list of non-English language newspapers</a> in Trove.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And another <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/trove-newspapers/blob/master/newspapers_post_54.csv">list of newspapers in Trove</a> with articles available from beyond the 1954 copyright cliff of death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While we’re on newspapers, here’s a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rURriHBSf3MocI8wsdl1114t0YeyU0BVSXWeg232MZs/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a> that identifies places of publication or circulation of Trove newspapers, and provides geocordinates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about some text? Here’s <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-books/#ocrd-text-from-trove-books-and-ephemera">24,620 files of OCRd text from digitised books and ephemera</a> in Trove. There’s also a <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-books/#csv-formatted-list-of-books-with-ocrd-text">CSV-formatted list</a> with the basic details of each book.</p>

<li>
<p>More text! Here’s <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-journals/#ocrd-text-from-trove-digitised-journals">OCRd text from 26,234 issues of 397 digitised journals</a> in Trove.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something different – a <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-journals/#politicians-talking-about-immigrants-and-refugees">collection of 12,619 press releases &amp; speeches by Australian politicians</a> that include any of the terms ‘immigrant’, ‘asylum seeker’, ‘boat people’, ‘illegal arrivals’, or &lsquo;boat arrivals&rsquo;.  From the Parliamentary Library via Trove.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some more images – a <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-journals/#editorial-cartoons-from-the-bulletin-1886-to-1952">collection of 3,471 full-page editorial cartoons from The Bulletin</a>, 1886 to 1952 (with a warning for racist content). Available both as individual images and compiled into PDFs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the ABC via Trove, there’s <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-music/#abc-radio-national-programs">400,000 records from Radio National programs broadcast since the late 1990s</a>. That includes every segment broadcast on AM, PM, RN Breakfast etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This might be handy – from some work I’m doing with ANU Archives, here’s a <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/anu-archives/blob/master/nsw_holidays_1900_1950.csv">CSV file containing details of holidays in NSW from 1901 to 1950</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet provides XML versions of more than 20,000 speeches &amp; interviews from recent PMs for download. I’ve <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/pm-transcripts/">saved them to a repository and compiled some indexes</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And finally – Commonwealth Hansard from the Parliamentary Library – lots of well-structured XML files! I’ve <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/hansard/">created a repo</a> with one file for each sitting day from 1901 to 1980 &amp; 1998 to 2005 (hopefully the gap will be filled soon). There’s also a <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/hansard/#list-of-sitting-days-1901-to-2005">CSV index to sitting days</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And if that’s not enough data, the GLAM Workbench provides tools to help you create your own datasets from Trove, the National Archives of Australia, the National Museum of Australia, Archives NZ, DigitalNZ, &amp; more! #dhhacks</p>

			 <p>In 2014 I pulled together a sample of web pages that included links back to digitised newspaper articles in Trove and created the ‘Trove Traces’ app. It was interesting, and sometimes disturbing, to see the diversity of sites that made use of Trove. Amongst the family and local history enthusiasts were climate change deniers and racists who found ‘evidence' for their views in past newspapers. And of course, the sample only includes links in web pages, not social media sharing.</p>

<p>The app has since disappeared, but I’ve <a href="https://timsherratt.org/shed/trovetraces/traces/index.html">now published a static version</a>.

			 <p>I’ve added an API Query Builder to the <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/digitalnz/">DigitalNZ section of the GLAM Workbench</a>. You can use it to learn about the different parameters available from the search API, and experiment with different queries. Just get your API key from DigitalNZ, then try entering keywords and selecting options. Once you understand how the API works, you can start thinking about how you can make use of it in your own projects.</p>
<p>👉🏻 <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/GLAM-Workbench/digitalnz/master?urlpath=voila%2Frender%2Fbuild_api_query.ipynb">Try it out live on Binder!</a></p>
<p>Under the hood the API Query Builder is a Jupyter notebook (of course), but it uses <a href="https://ipyvuetify.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">ipyvuetify</a> to create good-looking, responsive, form widgets. It’s intended to be run using <a href="https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">Voilà</a>, which turns notebooks into interactive apps and dashboards. You can now run any Jupyter notebook <a href="https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deploy.html#deployment-on-binder">using Voilà on Binder</a>, just by changing the url.</p>
<p>If this app seems useful (let me know!) I might put a version on Heroku so the start up time is reduced. I’m also thinking of using this sort of pattern to create apps for other APIs in the GLAM Workbench. #dhhacks</p>

			 <p>Lately I’ve been updating and expanding the notebooks in the <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/digitalnz/">DigitalNZ section</a> of the GLAM Workbench. In particular, I’ve been looking at the <code>usage</code> facet to understand how much of the aggregated content is ‘open’. What do I mean by ‘open’? The <a href="https://opendefinition.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation definition</a> states that ‘open data and content can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose’. Obviously things that are in the public domain, such as out-of-copyright resources, are open. But so are resources with an <a href="https://opendefinition.org/licenses/">open licence</a> such as <a href="https://opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by">CC-BY</a> or <a href="https://opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by-sa">CC-BY-SA</a>. The Creative Commons ‘Non commercial' and ‘No derivatives’ licences are <em>not</em> open because they put limits on how you can use resources.</p>
<p>How does this definition map to DigitalNZ? The <code>usage</code> facet includes <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/digitalnz/blob/master/facets/usage.csv">five values</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share</li>
<li>Modify</li>
<li>Use commercially</li>
<li>All rights reserved</li>
<li>Unknown</li>
</ul>
<p>These values have been assigned by DigitalNZ based on  the <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/digitalnz/blob/master/facets/rights.csv">35,000 different rights statements</a> and <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/digitalnz/blob/master/facets/copyright.csv">30 different copyright statements</a> that are included in DigitalNZ metadata records. I find I have to turn the <code>usage</code> values inside out to really understand them. A resource that only allows you to ‘Share’, excludes the ‘Modify’ and ‘Use commercially’ permissions and so is sort of equivalent to a CC-BY-ND-NC licence. The only open value, according to the definition above, is ‘Use commercially’, which is like CC-BY. I’m assuming that ‘Use commercially’ has been assigned to resources that either out of copyright (or with no known copyright restrictions)  or are openly licensed.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that the ‘usage’ values are not mutually-exclusive. A record with a ‘usage’ value of ‘Use commercially’, will also be assigned ‘Share’ and ‘Modify' values. This is because ‘Use commercially’ includes the &lsquo;Share&rsquo; and ‘Modify’ permissions. This seems a bit counter-intuitive, but makes sense if you think about doing a search for everything you&rsquo;re allowed to share.</p>
<p>A rough calculation based on the usage facet indicates that 71.76% of the resources aggregated by DigitalNZ are open. That seems pretty good, though a lot of those are probably out-of-copyright newspaper articles from Papers Past. For a more fine-grained analysis, I decided to look at the ‘usage’ data for each combination of ‘content_partner’ and ‘primary_collection’. How open is each individual collection in DigitalNZ?</p>
<p>For added excitement, and to stretch my knowledge of what <a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/">Altair</a> can do, I decided to visualise the results as display of colourful fireworks. The higher the explosion, the more open the collection! I’m pretty pleased with the result.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve saved <a href="http://timsherratt.org/shed/digitalnz/open_collections_digitalnz.html">a HTML version of the chart</a> so you can mouseover the explosions for more details. All the code is <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/digitalnz/#visualising-open-collections-in-digitalnz">included in this notebook</a>, along with a <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/digitalnz/blob/master/facets/usage_by_collection_and_partner.csv">CSV file</a> containing all the harvested facet data. #dhhacks</p>

			 <p>If you like browsing Trove&rsquo;s digitised newspapers page by page, you might have found that the current interface is a bit clunky. To move between pages you have to hover over the page number and click on &lsquo;Next&rsquo; or &lsquo;Previous&rsquo;. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be good if you could just use the arrow keys on your keyboard? Well now you can!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve created a very simple script that allows you to use the arrows on your keyboard to move between pages in Trove&rsquo;s digitised newspapers. Once it&rsquo;s enabled you can use the following shortcuts:</p>
<ul>
<li>⬆️ <strong>Up</strong> arrow – go to the first page of the previous issue</li>
<li>⬇️ <strong>Down</strong> arrow – go the the first page of the next issue</li>
<li>⬅️ <strong>Left</strong> arrow – go to the previous page</li>
<li>➡️ <strong>Right</strong> arrow – go to the next page</li>
</ul>
<p>Go here for <a href="https://gist.github.com/wragge/af8bd20a14005d267ffc759463bd832c">installation instructions</a>.</p>
<p>This makes browsing through a newspaper <em>much</em> easier. Enjoy! #dhhacks</p>

			 <p>There’s a <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-music/">new  GLAM Workbench section</a> for working with data from Trove’s Music &amp; Sound zone!</p>
<p><strong>Inside you&rsquo;ll find out how to harvest all the metadata from ABC Radio National program records – that&rsquo;s 400,000+ records, from 160 Radio National programs, over more than 20 years.</strong></p>
<p>It’s metadata only, so not full transcripts or audio, though there are links back to the ABC site where you might find transcripts. Most records should at least have a title, a date, the name of the program it was broadcast on, a list of contributors, and perhaps a brief abstract/summary. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that many of these records, particularly those from the main current affairs programs, represent individual stories or segments – so they provide a detailed record of the major news stories for the last couple of decades!</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-music/#harvest-abc-radio-national-records-from-trove">harvesting notebook</a> shows you how to get the data from the Trove API. There are a number of duplicate records, and some inconsistencies in the way the data is formatted, so the harvesting code tries to clean things up a bit. You can of course adjust this to meet your own needs.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to do the harvesting yourself, there’s <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-music/#abc-radio-national-programs">pre-harvested datasets</a> that you can download immediately from Cloudstor and start exploring. The complete harvest of all 400,000+ records is available both in JSONL (newline separated JSON) and CSV formats. There&rsquo;s also a series of separate datasets for the most frequently occurring programs: RN Breakfast, RN Drive, AM, PM, The World Today, Late Night Live, Life Matters, and the Science Show.</p>
<p>There’s also a <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-music/#exploring-abc-radio-national-metadata">notebook</a> that demonstrates a few possible ways you might start to play with the data – looking at the range of programs, the distribution of records over time, the people involved in each story, and words in the titles of each segment.</p>

			 <p>There are a growing number of non-English newspapers in Trove, but how do you know what&rsquo;s there? After trying a few different approaches, I generated a <a href="https://gist.github.com/wragge/9aa385648cff5f0de0c7d4837896df97">list of 48 newspapers</a> with non-English content. The full details are <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/trove-newspapers/blob/88a4415cd64de28a1fccba8a787018c6143b1a09/find-non-english-newspapers.ipynb">in this notebook</a>).</p>
<p>As the notebook describes, I found the language metadata for newspapers was incomplete, so I used some language detection code on a sample of articles from every newspaper to try and find those with non-English content. But this had its own problems – such as the fact that the language detection code thought that bad OCR looked like Maltese&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Anyway, if you’re just searching using English keywords, you might not even be aware that these titles exist. It’s important to explore ways of making diversity visible within large digitised collections. #dhhacks</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last year I did some analysis of the availability of open access versions of research articles published between 2008 and 2018 in <em>Australian Historical Studies</em>. I&rsquo;ve now broadened this out to cover all individual articles (with a DOI) across a number of journals. It&rsquo;s pretty grim. Despite Green OA policies that allow researchers to share versions of their articles through institutional repositories, Australian history journals still seem to be about 94% closed.</p>
<p>Full details are <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/wragge/ozhist-openaccess/blob/9e1f81cd3917a1a01b2cf4ac6cc376a63c9ff0a3/open_access_versions_australian_hass_journals.ipynb">in this notebook</a>.</p>
<p><strong>But this can be fixed!</strong> If you&rsquo;re in a university, talk to your librarians about depositing a Green OA version of your article in an institutional repository. If not, you can use the <a href="https://shareyourpaper.org/">Share your paper</a> service to upload a Green OA version to Zenodo. Your research will be easier to find, easier to access, easier to cite, and available to everyone – not just those with the luxury of an institutional subscription. #dhhacks</p>

			 <p><strong>Asking questions with web archives – introductory notebooks for historians</strong> has won the British Library Labs Research Award for 2020. <a href="https://data.bl.uk/bl_labs_awards/index.html">The awards</a> recognise &lsquo;exceptional projects that have used the Library’s digital collections and data&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This project gave me a chance to work with web archives collections and staff from the British Library, the National Library of Australia, and the National Library of New Zealand, and was <a href="https://netpreserve.org/projects/jupyter-notebooks-for-historians/">supported</a> by the International Internet Preservation Consortium&rsquo;s Discretionary Funding Program.</p>
<p>We developed a range of tools, examples, and documentation to help researchers use and explore the vast historical resources available through web archives. A new <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/web-archives/">web archives section</a> was added to the GLAM Workbench, and 16 Jupyter notebooks, combining text, images, and live code, were created.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://youtu.be/qhaRQ0LxNAo">30 second summary</a> of the project!</p>
<p>The judges noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The panel were impressed with the level of documentation and thought that went into how to work computationally through Jupyter notebooks with web archives which are challenging to work with because of their size. These tools were some of the first of their kind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Labs Advisory Board wanted to acknowledge and reward the incredible work of Tim Sherratt in particular. Tim you have been a pioneer as a one-person lab over many years and these 16 notebooks are a fine addition to your already extensive suite in your GLAM Workbench. Your work has inspired so many in GLAM, the humanities community, and BL Labs to develop their own notebooks. To our audience, we strongly recommend that you look at the GLAM Workbench if you’re interested in doing computational experiments with many institutions’ data sources.</p>

			 <p>Repositories in the <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/">GLAM Workbench</a> have been launched on <a href="https://mybinder.org/">Binder</a> 3,529 times since the start of this year (according to data from the <a href="https://archive.analytics.mybinder.org">Binder Events log</a>). That’s repository launches, not notebooks. Having launched a repository, users might use multiple notebooks. And of course these stats don’t include people using the notebooks in contexts other than Binder – on their own machines, servers, or services like AARNet’s SWAN. Or just viewing the notebooks in GitHub and copying code into their own projects.</p>
<p>I’m suspicious of web stats, but the Binder data indicates that people have actually done more than ‘visit’ – they’ve spun up a Binder session ready to do some exploration.</p>
<p>Every Jupyter notebook in the GLAM Workbench has a link that opens the notebook in Binder. If you click on the link, Binder reads configuration details from the repository and loads a customised computing environment. All in your browser! That means you can start using the GLAM Workbench without installing any software. Just click on the Binder link and start exploring!</p>
<p>There are about <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/">40 different repositories</a> in the GLAM Workbench, helping you work with data from Trove, DigitalNZ, NAA, SLNSW, NSW Archives, NMA, ArchivesNZ, ANU Archives &amp; more! The image below shows them ranked by number of Binder launches this year.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/web-archives/">web archives section</a> was added this year in collaboration with the IIPC, the UK Web Archive, the Australian Web Archive, and the NZ Web Archive. Its annual number of launches is inflated a bit by the development process. But there’s been 426 launches since it went public in June.</p>
<p>I’m really pleased to see the <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-harvester/">Trove newspaper harvester</a> up near the top. At least once a day (on average) someone’s been firing up the repository to grab Trove newspaper articles in bulk.</p>
<p>Overall, that’s about 11 GLAM Workbench repository launches a day on Binder. It might not seem like much, but that’s 11 research opportunities that didn’t exist before, 11 GLAM collections opened to exploration, 11 researchers building their digital skills…</p>
<p>As humanities researchers continue to learn of the possibilities of GLAM data and develop their digital skills the numbers will grow. It’s a start. And a reminder that not all research infrastructure needs to be built in Go8 unis, by large teams, with $millions. We can all contribute by sharing our tools and methods. #dhhacks</p>

			 <p>The Trove Newspaper &amp; Gazette Harvester has been updated to version 0.4.0. The major change is that if the OCRd text for an article isn&rsquo;t available through the API, it will be automatically downloaded via the web interface. What does this mean in practice? Well previously you couldn&rsquo;t harvest OCRd text from the <em>Australian Women&rsquo;s Weekly</em> because it&rsquo;s not included in API results, but now you can!</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to do anything differently. If there are AWW articles in your search, and you ask for all the OCRd text using the <code>--text</code> option, the AWW text files will automagically appear in your harvest.</p>
<p>Under the hood, I&rsquo;ve started using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/html2text/">html2text</a> to remove tags from the OCRd text. I think this should produce more consistent results. As previously, line breaks are removed by default from the OCRd text files. However, I&rsquo;ve now added a <code>--include_linebreaks</code> option if you&rsquo;d like to keep them. This generally produces text that is more human-readable, but note that the line breaks produced by OCR aren&rsquo;t always accurate.</p>
<p>Head to the <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-harvester/">GLAM Workbench to try it out</a>, or <a href="https://pypi.org/project/troveharvester/0.4.0/">download the code from PyPi</a>. #dhhacks</p>

			 <p>If you&rsquo;ve done any searching in Trove&rsquo;s digitised newspapers, you&rsquo;ve probably noticed that there aren&rsquo;t many results after 1954. This is basically because of copyright restrictions (though given the complexities of Australia&rsquo;s copyright system, you can&rsquo;t be sure that everything published before 1955 is <em>out</em> of copyright). We can visualise the impact of this by looking at the number of newspaper articles in Trove by year.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can see why I started referring to it as the <strong>copyright cliff of death</strong>.</p>
<p>But you can also see a little trickle of articles continuing post-1954. The number of newspapers from beyond the copyright cliff of death continues to increase as agreements are made with publishers to put them online. I just checked and there&rsquo;s now 83 newspapers that have at least <em>some</em> post-1954 articles available. Here&rsquo;s the top 10 (by number of articles).</p>

The first set of notebooks relates to the <a href="http://archivescollection.anu.edu.au/index.php/or59j">Sydney Stock exchange stock and share lists</a>. As the content note describes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These are large format bound volumes of the official lists that were posted up for the public to see - 3 times a day - forenoon, noon and afternoon - at the close of the trading session in the call room at the Sydney Stock Exchange. The closing prices of stocks and shares were entered in by hand on pre-printed sheets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The volumes have been digitised, resulting in a collection of 70,000+ high resolution images. You can browse the details of each volume using <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/anu-archives/blob/master/stock-exchange-details-by-volume.ipynb">this notebook</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve been exploring ways of getting useful, machine-readable data out of the images. There’s more information about the processes involved in <a href="https://github.com/wragge/sydney-stock-exchange">this repository</a>. I’ve also been working on improving the metadata and have managed to assign a date and session (Morning, Noon, or Afternoon) to each page. We these, we can start to explore the content!</p>
<p>One of the notebooks creates a <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/anu-archives/blob/master/stock-exchange-pages-calendar.ipynb">calendar-like view</a> of the whole collection, showing the number of pages surviving from each trading day.

			 <p>Any regular user of RecordSearch, the National Archives of Australia’s online database, will understand its frustrations. But here’s a handy little hack to fix a couple of annoying problems and add some useful functionality!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/wragge/b2af9dc56f7cb0a9476b">RecordSearch Show Pages userscript</a> updates links to digitised files in search results and item details pages, inserting the number of pages in a file. This means that you can easily scan a list of search results to see where the big fat files are, without having to click through to each one individually.</p>
<p>But wait there’s more! The script also rewrites the link to the digitised file viewer so that it opens in the current tab, as you would expect, and not in an annoying pop up window!</p>
<p>And as an extra bonus if you install now, the script also inserts a link on the barcode of an item in the digitised file viewer that takes you back to the item details page. Links to the digitised file viewer are shareable (unlike most RecordSearch links), but they don’t give you a way to find more information about the item. That problem is also fixed by this handy little script.</p>

			 <p>It was Open Access Week last week, so I tried a little experiment. How many research articles published in <em>Australian Historical Studies</em> between 2008 and 2018 are available via Open Access? Just <strong>9.5%</strong> (23 out of 242). This is despite the fact that all articles published in 2018 or earlier are outside of the journal’s embargo period and Green OA versions could be shared through repositories.</p>
<p>Here’s all the code, it could be easily modified to work with other journals: <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/wragge/ozhist-openaccess/blob/master/finding-oa-versions-of-AHS-articles.ipynb">nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/wr&hellip;</a> #dhhacks</p>

			 <p>If you try to share or bookmark the url of an item in RecordSearch (the National Archives of Australia&rsquo;s online database), you’ll often get a ‘Session time out’ error when you access it. That’s because the urls only work within the current active RecordSearch session. So how can you create a shareable link that works across sessions?

			 <p>We tend to think of a web archive as a site we go to when links are broken – a useful fallback, rather than a source of new research data. But web archives don&rsquo;t just store old web pages, they capture multiple versions of web resources over time. Using web archives we can observe change – we can ask historical questions.  But web archives store <strong>huge</strong> amounts of data, and access is often limited for legal reasons. Just knowing what data is available and how to get to it can be difficult. Where do you start?</p>
<p>The GLAM Workbench’s <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/web-archives/">new web archives section</a> can help! Here you’ll find a collection of Jupyter notebooks that  document web archive data sources and standards, and walk through methods of harvesting, analysing, and visualising that data. It’s a mix of examples, explorations, apps and tools. The notebooks  use existing APIs to get data in manageable chunks, but many of the examples demonstrated can also be scaled up to build substantial datasets for research – you just have to be patient!</p>
<p>Have you ever wanted to find when a particular fragment of text first appeared in a web page?  Or compare full-page screenshots  of archived sites?  Perhaps you want to explore how the text content of a page has changed over time, or create a side-by-side comparison of web archive captures. There are notebooks to help you with all of these.</p>
<p>To dig deeper you might want to assemble a dataset of text extracted from archived web pages, construct your own database of archived Powerpoint files, or explore patterns within a whole domain. The notebooks provide a range of approaches that can be extended or modified according to your research questions.</p>
<p>The development of these notebooks was supported by the International Internet Preservation Consortium&rsquo;s <a href="http://netpreserve.org/projects/">Discretionary Funding Programme 2019-2020</a>, with the participation of the British Library, the National Library of Australia, and the National Library of New Zealand. #dhhacks</p>

			 <p>For a couple of years I’ve been harvesting datasets created or published by Australian GLAM organisations through government data portals. I’ve just completed <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/glam-data-portals/#results-30-march-2020">the latest harvest</a>, and there’s now 369 datasets, containing 983 files, from 23 GLAM organisations. 628 of these files are in CSV (spreadsheet) format.</p>
<p>There’s a number of ways that you can explore the harvested data. You can <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/glam-datasets-from-gov-portals/">browse a big list of datasets</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/ozglam-data/blob/master/glam-datasets-from-gov-portals.csv">download a CSV</a> containing all the harvested data or <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/ozglam-data/blob/master/glam-datasets-from-gov-portals-csvs.csv">just those formatted as CSVs</a>.</p>
<p>With this harvest I’ve added a <a href="https://ozglam-datasets.glitch.me/data/glam-datasets-from-gov-portals">new way of searching and filtering the harvested data</a> using <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette">Datasette</a> running on Glitch. This interface lets you narrow your queries by field or facet, and search text fields for keywords.</p>
<p>But what’s actually in all those CSV files? If you’d like to start exploring the <em>content</em> of the datasets, then give my <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/csv-explorer/">GLAM CSV Explorer</a> a go! The CSV Explorer looks at each column in the dataset and tries to identify the type of data inside. It then attempts to tell you something useful about it.</p>

			 <p>Today version 1 of the Trove API was decommissioned. As I <a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2019/10/09/creators-and-users.html">explained elsewhere</a>, this meant that a number of Trove Twitter bots also died. The problem is that version 2 of the API provides no easy way to randomly select records. Bots, and other apps that share random content, require major reworking.</p>
<p>After a lot of experimentation, I’ve settled on a few methods for selecting random-ish results. They&rsquo;re far from perfect, but they seem to work reliably. My major concern is that it&rsquo;s hard to know how much of Trove is reachable by these methods. There may be resources that will never be found.</p>
<p>I’ve documented these methods in a <a href="https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/trove-random">series of Jupyter notebooks</a> so you can try them out yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/trove-random/blob/master/random_newspaper_article.ipynb">Get an random newspaper article from Trove</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/trove-random/blob/master/random_work_by_id.ipynb">Get a random work from Trove using work identifiers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/trove-random/blob/master/random_work_by_facets.ipynb">Get a random work from Trove using queries and facets</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve used these methods to rework the <a href="https://glitch.com/@wragge">Trove Twitter Bot starter kits</a> on Glitch that many people have used to create their own bots. This makes upgrading bots a pretty easy task. Each of the new starter kits provides instructions for current bot owners on how they can resurrect their creations.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://twitter.com/wragge/lists/trove-bots">feed of Trove bot tweets</a> is looking a little sad tonight. Most of the 43 bots on my list seem to have stopped tweeting. I hope that their owners won&rsquo;t feel discouraged, and will instead take the chance to upgrade their creations. And maybe a few new bots will be created as well.</p>

			 <h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>
<p>Version 1 of the Trove API will be discontinued soon so Trove Twitter bots need to be upgraded. Unfortunately, Version 2 of the Trove API doesn’t support the random selection of resources, so the current behaviour of many bots will change.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>In January 2018, I created a series of templates on Glitch that made it easy for people <a href="https://101dhhacks.net/2018/01/21/trove-bots-for-all/">to build their own Trove Twitter bots</a>. And they did! It was very exciting to see the <a href="https://twitter.com/wragge/lists/trove-bots/members">number of bots grow</a>, and I was particularly pleased by the number of bot builders who professed to being ‘non-coders’. Yay!</p>
<p>Most of these bots share random selections from Trove. This is done by first finding the total number of results in a query, generating a random number between zero and the total, and using the <code>s</code> parameter to retrieve the selected record.</p>
<p>However, Version 2 of the Trove API changed the behaviour of the <code>s</code> parameter to support more efficient bulk harvesting. Using Version 2, it’s not possible to select random records without a lot of additional code, and perhaps not at all.</p>
<p>When Version 2 of the API was released, I let the Trove team know that this change would have a major impact of Twitter bots, and any other application that randomly selects records. I was told this would be looked at before Version 1 of the API was discontinued. As a result I held off updating the bots until the situation was clear.</p>
<p>Version 2.1 of the API was released <a href="https://help.nla.gov.au/sites/default/files/API%20V2.1%20-%20Whats%20Changed%20-%20Full%20Text%20Search%20Release.pdf">a few weeks back</a> with some great new features, but no added randomness. The announcement also noted that Version 1 would be switched off in November. I checked with the Trove team and was told that no changes were planned to the API to support the selection of random records.</p>
<p>So the Twitter bots need some major work, and soon…</p>
<h2 id="possible-solutions">Possible solutions</h2>
<p>First the good news. Version 2 of the API is much faster and more reliable. Also, <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/trove-list-bot">Trove List Bots</a> won’t be affected by this change, as the list items aren’t paginated anyway.</p>
<p>Some random-ish selection of records will still be possible, but it’s going to take a bit of thinking, and the solution won’t be generally applicable across all the bots. The maximum number of results returned by a single API request is 100. So if the bots can use filters and facets to limit their query to less than 100 results, they could then select one at random.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/trove-title-bot">Trove Title Bot</a> (which tweets random articles from a specific newspaper) could be reconfigured to use the decade, year, and month facets to split up the result set. In fact, <a href="https://twitter.com/TroveNewsBot?">TroveNewsBot</a> already does this to try and get around some of the inefficiencies of Version 1 of the API.</p>
<p>Another approach might be to use some sort of random ‘seed’ to limit the query. For example, the Title Bot could select a date at random, and search for articles published on that day.</p>
<p><a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/trove-tag-bot">Tag Bots</a> and <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/trove-collection-bot">Collection Bots</a> will create a different set of challenges. The types of facets and filters that will be most effective will depend, to some extent, on the nature of the collection itself. For example, if the items in the collection were all created at about the same time, then the <code>date</code> filter might not be very useful.</p>
<p>Narrowing down the result set in this way will probably require multiple API requests. And, in many cases, it’s likely that it will be impossible to get the total down below 100. Playing with the sort options might open up this window a bit, but I think that the range of results from which the bots draw their ‘randomly’ selected results will, in most cases, be limited. Some items will never be shared.</p>
<p>Does this matter? People who follow the bots on Twitter might not notice much difference. But the bots’ ability to surface unexpected content will be hampered. They’ll still be sharing records, but they’ll also be hiding some. I think this matters.</p>
<h2 id="the-plan">The plan</h2>
<p>With Version 1 of the API being switched off in November, time is short. I’m also currently in the midst of preparing our house for sale ahead of a move to Tasmania. Eeeek!</p>
<p>I’m planning to create updated versions of all the bot templates on Glitch. They’ll be modified to use Version 2 of the Trove API and I’ll also take the chance to update them to Python 3. I’ll try implementing some of the random-ish strategies described above and see how they work. My aim at this stage is really just to try and keep people’s creations alive and tweeting.</p>
<p>For bot creators/maintainers, the upgrade process should be pretty painless. It should just be a matter of hitting the ‘remix’ button on the updated templates, copying across the configuration details from the current bot, and then adjusting your Cron service to point at the new bot. Of course, if you’ve made any customisations, you’ll have to copy these across to the new code.</p>
<p>As I noted, Collection and Tag bots might require some additional customisation to make sure as much of the collection as possible is exposed.</p>
<p>I’ll document the upgrade process and will be available on Twitter to help. I’m hoping to get this done in the next couple of weeks. Please bear with me…</p>
<h2 id="trovenewsbot-and-trovebot">TroveNewsBot and TroveBot</h2>
<p>I’ll also have to make some changes to <a href="https://twitter.com/TroveNewsBot">TroveNewsBot</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TroveBot">TroveBot</a> which have seen sharing Trove resources with the world since 2013. As with the Glitch bots, their ability to share random items and respond to the #luckydip hashtag will be limited, however, their ability to respond to other queries shouldn’t be affected.</p>
<h2 id="other-apps">Other apps</h2>
<p>There are various other apps that I’ve created over the years that will be affected by this change — most notably the game <a href="http://headlineroulette.net/">Headline Roulette</a>. People who have forked or remixed versions of Headline Roulette will also need to make some changes. I’ll let you know once I’ve worked out what needs to happen.</p>
<h2 id="the-value-of-randomness">The value of randomness</h2>
<p>I’ve written elsewhere about the way Twitter bots can <a href="https://medium.com/open-glam/life-on-the-outside-collections-contexts-and-the-wild-wild-web-4d334ccddee2">mobilise collections</a>, letting them loose in places where people congregate rather than waiting for visitors to find your website. I’ve also talked about the <a href="http://timsherratt.org/blog/muliplication-of-contexts/">value of play</a> in coming to grips with large cultural collections.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Collection bots are versions of ourselves, unable to contain our excitement at our latest discoveries. Look at what I found! They point to the play, to the fun, of research. But they also offer glimpses of a larger unknown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ability to select random items from a large cultural collection may seem trivial. But it opens up opportunities for creativity and engagement that I think are really important. If you agree, you might like to contact the Trove team and let them know — hopefully a bit of randomness might make it into future API upgrades.</p>

			 <p>NSW State Archives publishes a number of <a href="https://www.records.nsw.gov.au/archives/collections-and-research/guides-and-indexes/indexes-a-z">detailed indexes</a> containing data manually extracted from their records. These provide additional entry points to the records, such as a person&rsquo;s name, or a place. But they also provide useful data for analysis. However, to explore the index data we need to get it out of the web interface and into a form that can be easily downloaded and manipulated.</p>
<p>I’ve created a series of Jupyter notebooks to harvest the all the indexes and save the data in a series of CSV-formatted files. I’ve also updated my repository containing all the harvested CSV files. It’s available from the new <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/nsw-state-archives/">NSW State Archives section</a> of my GLAM Workbench. There are currently 64 different index datasets, containing 1,499,259 rows of data.</p>
<p>And to help you get a sense of what&rsquo;s actually in all those CSV files, I’ve created an interactive Index Explorer. Just select an index from the list, and the Index Explorer will generate a series of tables and visualisations that provide an overview of the data. Try <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/GLAM-Workbench/nsw-state-archives/master?urlpath=%2Fapps%2Findex-explorer.ipynb">running it live</a> on Binder.</p>

			 <p>Today I finished updating a harvest of all OCRd text available from Trove’s digitised journals. That’s about 7gb of text from 30,462 issues of 384 different journals — a fab corpus for text analysis! <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-journals/">Here’s all the metadata, links, and harvesting code</a>. @TDHASSN #dhhacks</p>

			 <p>Over the last week I&rsquo;ve been downloading editorial cartoons published in <em>The Bulletin</em> from @TroveAustralia. There&rsquo;s 3,471 cartoons – at least one from every issue published between 4 Sep 1886 and 17 Sep 1952. And you can browse them all&hellip;</p>
<p>To make it easier to explore the images, I&rsquo;ve compiled them into a series of PDFs – one PDF for each decade. The PDFs include lower resolution versions of the images together with their publication details and a link to Trove. They&rsquo;re all <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rulkbsqgfe8cyhv/AABel9b95buJSG5hZrVCvaQsa?dl=0">available from DropBox</a>:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>The complete collection of high resolution images (about 60gb in total) can be <a href="https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/bI7hJREvO0oJLGL">downloaded from CloudStor</a>. The names of each image file provide useful contextual metadata. For example, the file name <code>19330412-2774-nla.obj-606969767-7.jpg</code> tells you:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>19330412</code> – the cartoon was published on 12 April 1933</li>
<li><code>2774</code> – it was published in issue number 2774</li>
<li><code>nla.obj-606969767</code> – the Trove identifier for the issue, can be used to make a url eg <code>[nla.gov.au/nla.obj-6...](https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-606969767)</code></li>
<li><code>7</code> – on page 7</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s some details of the method that I used to find the cartoons <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/trove-journals/blob/master/Finding_editorial_cartoons_in_the_Bulletin.ipynb">in this notebook</a>. I&rsquo;ve also documented everything in the <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-journals/">Trove Journals section</a> of my GLAM Workbench.</p>
<p>Be warned – the language, images, and ideas presented in <em>The Bulletin</em> were often racist, anti-Semitic, and sexist. You won’t have to look far within this collection to find something offensive. This was, after all, the journal whose slogan for many years was ‘Australia for the white man’. This is our history&hellip; #dhhacks</p>

			<h1><a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2019/02/26/dhhacks-save-a.html">#dhhacks — Save a page image from the State Archives of NSW&#39;s Bubonic Plague Register</a></h1>

			 <p>So NSW State Archives has digitised the <a href="https://www.records.nsw.gov.au/archives/magazine/bubonic-plague">Register of Cases of Bubonic Plague 1900-1908</a>. Great work! Unfortunately though, they&rsquo;ve put the digitised page images in one of those annoying page-turnery things, without any obvious way of downloading them (please correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong!).</p>
<p>Even more annoyingly, the page-turnery thing disables your browser&rsquo;s right click, so you can&rsquo;t view and save individual images that way either. However, if you&rsquo;re using Firefox there is an easy way to stop sites interfering with your mouse&rsquo;s normal behaviour and restore your right click.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>First enter <code>about:config</code> in your location bar and hit enter. That loads Firefox&rsquo;s configuration settings page. Then find the entry for <code>dom.event.contextMenu.enabled</code> and set it to <code>false</code> by double clicking it. That&rsquo;s it!</p>
<p>Now go to any page in the register. Go to full screen and zoom in to get the biggest image. Right click, and select &lsquo;Save Image As&hellip;&rsquo;. Bingo!</p>

		<a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2019/01/26/talking-about-immigrants.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-01-26 11:08:26 &#43;1000">Jan 26, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;m giving a talk in a week or so (eep!) that looks at some of the changing contexts in which the word &lsquo;aliens&rsquo; has been used in Australia. I thought, by way of comparison, it would be useful to do the same for &lsquo;immigrants&rsquo;. While I was playing around with the data last night, I came across something interesting, so here&rsquo;s a sneak preview&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="getting-the-data">Getting the data</h3>
<p>Using my <a href="https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-harvester/">TroveHarvester</a> I downloaded the full text of all newspaper articles in Trove that included the word &lsquo;immigrants&rsquo;. I used the <code>text:</code> modifier to turn off stemming, and limited the results to the <code>Article</code> category. <a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/result?l-category=Article&amp;q=text%3Aimmigrants">Here&rsquo;s the query I used.</a> After the harvest had finished, I had 505,296 text files to play with.</p>
<p>I then used a regular expression — <code>[\w,]+(?=\s+immigrants)</code> — to find words appearing before the word &lsquo;immigrants&rsquo; in the text files. I found 642,447 occurences across those 505,296 articles.</p>
<p>Using Pandas I calculated the frequency of each word. <a href="https://gist.github.com/wragge/7f663a9133d63371329c5baa8a7f729e">Here&rsquo;s a CSV</a> with all the words that have a frequency greater than 100. There&rsquo;s plenty of OCR errors in the mix of course, I haven&rsquo;t tried any cleaning up.</p>
<h3 id="hmm-thats-interesting">Hmm, that&rsquo;s interesting</h3>
<p>For my talk I&rsquo;ll be looking at words like &lsquo;undesirable&rsquo; and &lsquo;prohibited&rsquo;, but the thing that struck me last night were the words describing the ethnic origins of immigrants — &lsquo;Chinese&rsquo;, &lsquo;German&rsquo;, &lsquo;British&rsquo; etc. I thought I&rsquo;d have a go at visualising how the use of these terms varied over time. The chart below includes words with an overall frequency greater than 500. The only change I made to the categories was to merge &lsquo;scotch&rsquo; and &lsquo;scottish&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that this isn&rsquo;t about the number of immigrants arriving in Australia, it&rsquo;s a reflection of <strong>which groups of immigrants were being talked about, and when</strong>. So, for example, &lsquo;Chinese immigrants&rsquo; feature prominently in newspapers of the 1880s as legislation is introduced to restrict their entry to the Australian colonies.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like a larger version of this chart, you can <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/nzfooyejep6anpb/words_before_immigrants.png?dl=0">download it here</a>.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2019/01/15/adventures-in-stemming.html">Adventures in stemming, or what happens when you search Trove for &#39;naturalization&#39;</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://updates.timsherratt.org/2019/01/15/adventures-in-stemming.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-01-15 11:46:19 &#43;1000">Jan 15, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><strong>Fun fact</strong> — the Porter stemming algorithm treats the words &lsquo;naturalisation&rsquo; and &lsquo;naturalization&rsquo; differently. Naturalisation is stemmed to &lsquo;naturalis&rsquo;, naturalization to &lsquo;natur&rsquo;. You can try this yourself using this <a href="https://text-processing.com/demo/stem/">NLTK stemming demo</a>.</p>
<p>Why does this matter? If you try <a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/result?q=naturalization">searching for &lsquo;naturalization&rsquo;</a> in Trove you get almost 14 million results, most of which aren&rsquo;t relevant because they&rsquo;re matching words like &lsquo;nature&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Of course you can switch off stemming in Trove by using the <code>text:</code> modifier. A <a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/result?q=text%3Anaturalization">search for <code>text:naturalization</code></a> returns only 17,000 results. But now we&rsquo;ll be missing related terms such as &lsquo;naturalized&rsquo;, so we have to explicity include any forms of the word that we want.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if this applies to other s/z spellings, but given that historical sources (in Australia at least) often tend to use both forms it&rsquo;s something to keep in mind when you&rsquo;re constructing your searches. #dhhacks</p>
